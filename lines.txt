>yeah but couldn't you have two tanks (or 1 tank with a bladder creating two separate areas with one constant volume), one at max pressure and the other at 1 atm, and basically capture the exhaust (decompress to do work, then allow pressure to naturally build back up on other end) until the system reaches equilibrium, and then open the system to the outside, adding 50% to your storage because you recapture the first half of what you usethen your system reaches equilibruim, which will be a pressure value higher than atmospheric pressure, meaning the pressure differential is still reduced at any given charge,the only way to scavange energy from a decompressing gas is to capture the coldness of the expanding gas, and use that coldness to pre-cool air before it is compressed later

also i will imply that i will release benchmarks at some point!>2020: still no benchmarks>benchmarks run by other people find that alacritty actually is on the slow end for input latency>not to mention the atrocious font rendering>and the numerous bugs encountered when rendering more than just plain ascii textthe only thing alashitty is for is scrolling with the mousewheel through your manpages and vim sessions like a retard who can't use page down
also i'd require quite a number of packages and that's also intimidating since i gotta learn all those too

also it can slightly improve multi-core lzma2 decompression speed.some important parts of ppmd code were rewritten for faster compression and decompression.and that new ppmd code works faster for data that is not too compressible, like exe files or already compressed data.also ppmd in previous 7-zip could be slow in some intel cpus for decompression, if cve-2018-3639 speculative store bypass (ssb) mitigation was enabled in system

also most of my best stories/ memories over the years come from there, but it's a medium speed board and it takes a while to get used to it.

also support lmao what are you even thinking, all it takes is a browser update.
also thanks to mining pools the whole decentralized property is lost
also that shit filters out a lot of posts and literally makes people invisible
also that's how most faggots get their aids.
also the 5 is suppose to have 5g standard on it i think, so buying a 4a with 5g is kind of silly because you are just buying a more expensive version of a weaker phone
also the ear cups seem more over ear rather than on ear which i also like
also the fact he got a new machine and can't do a fucking screw they wanted lol now imagine that shit with memory or something more advanced
also the good tb3 adapters are expensive as hell
also the job description lists a bunch of stuff i've done, but it appears it's just a reports developer with some integration.really the posting is hiding the details.
also the old keeb
also the reason i even considered gigabyte is because asus has really soured me on this, because i know someone else with the same board and the same issue
also there is no notion of how much you have to use each word to be flagged.i remember an old article where people buying casio f-91w where flagged.
also there was the occulus go, which should fit your needs and is rather cheap.
also there's weird stuff like zune
also these are babby ultrabook chips

also, i don't need anything samshit ever again.not everyone doesn't not use their smartphone such that the bare minimum provided by mid-rangers is okay.
also, i dont know what the mail security is like in your country
also, i haven't found any other threads in the archives answering this.
also, i prefer macos as a daily driver, and the google employee fact is true, a simple google search will bring you the truth
also, i use the pc for graphic editing so, i would like it to be good enough for those programs and vr ready.so, considering that i have laying around a rx 580 aorus 8gb like new, ssd, hdd...im considering this setup>cpu ryzen r5 3600ram 8x2 ddr4moba / something compatiblegpu rx 580 8gbmonitor 2k or 4k because i need it for editingwhat you guys think?
also, i'm aware that closing the buffer restores the window configuration, but that doesn't make any less annoying.

also, the world is ending (soon).
also, there is a programming general you know?
also, there's a v4 rework project in-progress - i don't follow on that, but maybe it's worth checking out
also, these are not individual pixels but 8x8 rectangles of pixels, so changing the resolution might work, but i'm pretty sure the performance would be the same, since the internal graphics chip would still need to draw the individual real pixels in the full-scale resolution.i'm not sure what you mean by color-mode here, tgi (the graphics library) supports one loaded palette of two colors at a time, so i'm using black and white.
also, these guys say they are selling a tesla graphene batteryhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flash-world-s-most-powerful-210w-usb-c-powerbankeven though they also say in an update that tesla told them to stop using their brand lelhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flash-world-s-most-powerful-210w-usb-c-powerbank#/updates/all>>77274666u wot m8

although covid has fucked things at the moment
although i believe they have to retain some information
although i did it before with android phones, i always wanted to do it with an apple product, just for fun.
although i should've known better than to assume that something is universally applicable in the linux community.
although it can be said you can prevent a lot of the most common attacks by disabling javascript, i still wouldn't recommend it.i would recommend looking into oses like whonix, tails, and qubes if you are serious about getting into onionland.
although it doesn't matter for me cause i've disabled itunes updates through powershell.do i dare swap to rockbox?
although it was my first va panel when all i had were ips monitors and i feel scammed in that department, but there just aren't 32 1080p 120+hz ips around here.

although, i prefer the second; use array methods as much as you can, since all the cool kid are using them.
altough risc is better than cisc, arm sucks
always
always better than c
always check prior art extensively before sperging out
always curious what's out there.
always get the cheaper model pixels
always go for phones with snapdragon socs, because those are the developer friendly ones and the ones gcam is developed for.>is there another phone i should look at that's below the 200euro range?i'd say mi 9 lite
always has been http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/
always just wrote it off as an amd thing, but i've tried switching components anyway, and to no avail, though i expected that as my last machine was fine.
always make it wear a case, store alone in pocket, screen facing your leg
always me.
always opt for the higher frequency for any given true latency but don't sweat it too much
always remember that everyone in your life is cursing you in their head as you drone on and on about the jews or the liberals or the commies or the niggers or the faggots or whatever comically stupid boogeyman you get manipulated into being scared of next.
always the same with itoddlers throughout time:> i think everything will transition to 68000 from 6502 eventually> i think everything will transition to ppc from 68000 eventually> i think everything will transition to x86 from ppc eventually
always wanted to set it upo with my phone
always wondered why arch doesn't use the same approach.>the only serious problem with alpine i have is it's usage of musl instead of glibc.yes, but then again it's also one of their main selling points.

amazing ad hominem and explanation
amazing how expensive computers were back then only to become basically obsolete 5 years later and totally obsolete 10 years later
amazon and roku can't get hbo max or peacock
amazon has cloud business and that fucking skyrocketed over the last decade
amazon has that shit, in america at least.
amazon processes returns for prime shipped items purchased from there, so it's a pretty seamless process - takes a few button presses and you can just drop off the item at an amazon store or whatever retailer they partner with.
amazon reviews were mixed but i guess that's what i get for reading amazon.
amazon supplies shitty 160s and vbr
amazon's not going to just let you live in vrchat rent-free either, and your job options are limited when you don't even have a body
amd and intel are perpetually using each other as an antitrust shield
amd apus even have higher clock speeds now so that's no longer the issue.
amd became completely noncompetitive
amd destroyed nvidia its so sad
amd did a good job in linux drivers.
amd fx bulldozer, pentium 4 or a hyperthreaded pentium 4?also can they give me viruses if i plug a usb into my intel-me computer?
amd had never viewed the premium/high-end price bracket as their top prioritychange my mind
amd has been the #1 gaming cpu for consoles for decades now.because consoles are for poorfags who can just get by with amd's poor performance.
amd helps write mesa and vulkan, while nvidia is gay and homosexual
amd is reportedly going to invest 1 billion dollars into intel over the next 5 years to help them out
amd makes like 1/5 of what intel does in consumer market and that's not even going to datacenters.
amd only reason to exist right now is to stop the government from breaking nvidia down due to anti monopoly laws nigga.
amd people may want to stay updated since the amdgpu module is not yet very mature.
amd probably makes more money from nvidia selling dgx than they do from selling socs for consoles
amd ryzen 9 5950x
amd said in their navi reveal stream that they’re working with microsoft to get the rt to be good (don’t remember the name, but it’s microsoft api)
amd should buy the rights to thunderbolt from intel and then they would have it all
amd will hopefully have an acceptable launch for bignavi that will drive overall prices a bit down and we will have choice.keep in mind that an entry level card nowadays is not the same as an entry card from before, they push a lot of pixels
amd's current stock price is a bubble anyway because intel announced 7nm delays
amd, no contest for your use
amd64 was a good compromise
amdgpu is the best thing to have ever happened to amd.
ame is based
amen
amen.

american soldiers and gun nuts despise them.
americans are dumb as hell, and cantonese are also dumb as hell in my experience
americans are just overcompensating high fahrenheit numbers with their lost foreskin.
americans are racist on the internet but in real life they love giving the brown man their job and the black man their wife.
americans need a constant foreign enemy otherwise they'll destroy themselves
americans of /g/, what is your excuse for not having a job in the sv?
americans seething they are no longer the center of the world anymore.
amerimutt are irrelevant

an extension most certainly does need a fuse
an immune system different enough to you (so you dont get deficiency overlap) but not so different that it doesnt really work

and good fucking lord; this thing is insufferably slow and unusable.(if possible) how do i make this thing at least decently/moderately fast and make it so shit doesn't crash in the background every 5 seconds?
and half of his videos are basic cope.
and has nothing to do with chinks
and he needs freedom.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d47cvlyouli&list=flgqu7fxujtk0qwfdsfkafia&index=8&t=0s
and he's married too!
and here i am pounding back triple scoops of preworkout for my 8-12 hour marathon sessions..
and here we go, cue you people saying you were abused as a teen and everything turned out fine and that the problem is just those mean adults and their taboos
and honestly, if you think that great firewall text works, you're double retarded
and how do you expect to protect your os if the whole code is visible to everyone?but i guess rape victims like you love to keep their doors open
and how much of it should be done in a school?
and i can't package that for you, unfortuneatly
and i can't use sites like tinder since it's not only proprietary software but a major privacy vulnerability
and i didn't even start talking about their social credit score that's rolled out across the country now.so no
and i do watch lots of videos, anime
and i don't even a very fast computer for that t.b.h
and i don't mean only syntactically, although there's also an argument there, but in terms of compilers and standard lib functions.you can also see how comparatively little important software there is in these languages for how old they are.
and i don't mean the normal everyday commands, i mean actual scripting
and i don't need some random company selling my genetic data to the highest bidder.
and i don't want to wait for 1+ years.
and i dont have the space for an actual mic.how much bad did i fuck up with this?
and i dont know where to begin since i want to make a full career out of this shit.im kinda shit at mathi want to know what language will give me the best basis, to start working and to branch out into whatever ends up being what i like.
and i gave it a shadow yoooooooothere's something wrong with you anon
and i get confused by all the optionsi mainly play non-competitive games (and i like them crisp colours), then watch media and browse the net and stuffi'm also finding my eyes get sore easily when looking at my screen for too long, is there anything that effects this?
and i had to switch for a smaller travelling sffpc so these are the last pics
and i know that chinkmoot wont do anything about it
and i know you know it.....which means if you flat out refuse to work with others who have slightly different views than you on how things should work, then actually, you are already the one who’s sinning.life’s hard anon, and it’s worth striving for a better life for yourself and your children but you were given free will and an intelligent mind for a reason
and i sincerely hope everyone else on here got it free one way or another too, or got it from their computer's oem.
and i think my biggest contention is the gratuitous nature of its flaws
and i use it to browse 4chins while i'm gaming with my pc.
and i want to be able to run everything.
and i was on the fence about you actually defending them, but this horseshit confirmed it.
and i went through a lot of depressed episodes while in uni...so idk
and i would never give up my clunky thinkpad x200
and i'd like to put the chromium web store extension on it, so i can keep ublock origin up to date and install it directy from the chrome web store.
and i'm a fucking scrub at this shit.
and i'm alright with that.
and i'm currently thinking of buying a used silicongraphics indigo computer to do it
and i'm not going to invest in it anymore, i considered it a while back, but used z87 boards were relatively expensive.
and i'm saying this as someone who uses ubuntu daily for work
and i'm secure that some international law too.but it's the ameriturds, no one is going to do anything to stop them, more over, they're going to start spying themselves as people accept it.
and if i need to do manual work i already can do it with 7z/rar files so there is no reason to switch
and if not books, is it only learnable through exp?
and if people don't actually use a technology prices gains are from speculation not extrinsic value
and if so, do i need to uninstall windows 8.1 from old hdd before running windows 10 from my new ssd?
and if so, how do you like them?
and if so, how does it work?i have a feeling that companies won't bother hiring 2x as many employees.if you've done paired programming as your, share your experience
and if the program you want isn't in the repository, you have to find the source code, dig up instructions for compiling it and go through the lengthy and confusing process of compilation.this is why linux will never be used on desktop in any serious capacity.
and if the solution is this complex and not only a flag is even worst.
and if those go under, the nature of linux means that someone out there will always make some new distro for server circlejerking.
and if you aren't then what's your excuse for being alive
and if you can't overthrow american then you have no rights and are literally a slave
and if you need to root/flash gsis, you've got the unihertz titan which is what happens when a blackberry passport and a backhoe fuck.even runs lineage :)
and if you think you can trust 3rd party scripts i implore you to check this link outhttps://yro.slashdot.org/story/16/05/19/232216/google-is-a-serial-trackeranybody could be doing it, even if you think they're above it like i once thought google was
and if you want to complain about how posix make isn't expressive enough for complex projects, cmake's scripting language is even less expressive
and if you want to release your game on console then you have no choice but to use their storefront.there are a handful of companies/games that have managed to be successful on the pc platform without steam (blizzard, riot games, jagex, epic games, cave story, etc.) but those are the exceptions rather than the rule and they either use a f2p model or they already have an established, loyal audience and they're backed by a company that has the resources to do everything themselves.
and if you were paying attention, the xbox is on in the picture.the rest of the pics of my battlestation room are just closeups of other various shit on the walls.
and if youre not a fan of the tiles, install openshell.why would i ever use windows botnet edition?
and impossible to audit
and in 1991 a finnish cs student decided to copy it for lulz with all its dependence on 1970s hardware limitations and we now have the clusterfuck that is linux
and in 2027, vr/ar.
and in a piracy general of all places
and is slimmer
and it also has ads.>searches for linux problems>>how to fix ..
and it doesn't need gigabytes of compatibility layers
and it isn't indicated what cmyk color space the values are getting converted to.
and it looks half decent.
and it only loses slightly in efficiency since it's gold vs platinum, about 90-91% vs 93-94% but lower or identical noise levels as those.
and it seems i'm still on ipv4.did they cancel it somehow?
and it should only be used to push the lord's work.jesus christ is the lord and savior
and it took off
and it was.
and it will tank
and it works on every browser but chrome.
and it would take 2 months in which you don't have access to the device!
and it's a shame because having a weak dsl for making macros is so inelegant, a much more 'schemic' (beautiful and minimalist) solution would be to just write scheme macros in scheme, like cl does
and it's got wsl2 now.
and it's not even internal method.
and it's not just you; there's also a ton of desktops adopting an ironic '80s-'90s look that get ridiculous attention despite looking like absolute ass
and it's one of the most free as in freedom compliant machines available
and it's one of the reasons why a nuclear war is one of the best outcomes this century can have
and it's still relatively comparable to shell in terms of shittyness compared to everything else
and it's very easily explained away anyway
and its quite shit
and i’m not gay so ubuntu isn’t an option.
and jensen hwang will laugh maniacally as he busts yet another load into your throat after brutally raping your mouth
and jerry carries a knife to class.
and just like business, if a better offer appears, take it.
and let me guess, you need more
and look at the size of the monsters noctua makes.
and magnets are fucking everywhere now-a-days, would not be surprised if they're all corrupt.
and manjaro doesn't really break except for specific aur packages that you have to fix yourself, arch occasionally does but that's not really the best beginner distro.
and manjaro updates their packages a little bit later then arch, so if any problems happen upstream they have the time to fix that.
and more good software
and most people here would not want link to their github or similar sites for a number of reasons
and most won't require several months and a lawsuit threat to take down rape cp.
and moving to zsh?
and multitasking used to be (or is it still?) atrocious
and new ppmd code must work faster for such cases too.another change of 7-zip 20.01 is speed optimization in delta filter code, that is about two times faster than in previous version.
and next year tok tik will emerge.
and no one audits that shit obviously.this is why i stick to backend
and no, the malware i was getting rid of came first, it wasn't even copying malware byte's design.
and not one of those crappy wimpy modern switches being passed off as the real thing.
and nothing ever tears
and nothing im aware of changed on my phone, no updates
and nothing of value was lost.
and now i try to download the highest-rated screen recorder on the software installer
and now that they are sold at such freaking ridicoulous low prices, sli is a freaking steal!
and now there are more 4k hdr ultra benchmarks whoch weren't there before so it seems like the older cards shouldn't even be considered.
and nsa's top level but from what i read us suffers more cyber crime from china than vice versa
and on mine with just ubo
and on phones for the last many years, youve had almost complete backwards compatibility.
and only on the safari web browser.what the fuck is up with that?
and other thing
and people try to be too goddamn nice and wholesome on that fucking site
and proof is where?
and pushes you even deeper into her body
and pushes you even deeper into her.ai:>she begins to control your mind
and put them on display in a fucking bookshelf??
and raspi 1b.
and remember, /g/ is your tech support.
and run all my other software from my old hdd (c disk)
and she respects and takes copyright seriously
and sit comfortably watching their anime with their stable stax builds.
and soi devs will balance around that
and stallman lazyness.
and still better than humans posters.
and suddenly normies and sheep retards are surprised to discover that they're fenced in
and söiboy becomes basedboy.
and that coolermaster topre clone.
and that would be it.
and that your probably a faggot too.
and that's a bad thing.if everything would be clear, transparent, then there would be no bad people, because everyone would know who they are
and that's before you touch the actual internal workings of the cpus that aren't exposed to programs that use the instruction set.
and that's even worse!but ubuntu is debian too, though.
and that's fine, but they're charging $300 for this
and that's okay with me
and that's pre-release hardware with last-generation chips.
and that's the reason interviewers should be real programmers and not retards trying to boost their egos
and thats what it will look like with rads attached.
and thats why every other lang has it's unified repo.
and thats why you don't count on afterlife or reincartion bsachieve goals in single life ya got
and that’s one thing xbox don’t got, xbox ain’t got gaaaaames
and the admin interface could use some work.
and the all-powerful, all-knowing dev wrote the software you couldn't do shit without
and the answer is jpeg-xl, the meme format by the joint photographic experts group.
and the author is probably homosexual.
and the cat's in the cradle with the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon....
and the culture of boring code helps.>>77239508it's unfortunate, but it's what you naturally end up with if you have good closures, and good closures are great to have.you can avoid the problem by making sure the variable is declared within the loop
and the customer service thanks to paypal it's still pretty good and very much in favour of the buyer
and the extensions have got pretty good recently.
and the one's that aren't blocked are fucking circlejerk between them, for that i have twitter that doesn't block half their userbase for no reason and if you report left winger racists, they take action against them.roll your own if you don't like how others manage theirs
and the top rung can do things unimaginable compared to before?
and the us is not much better, they enslave people in for profit prisons by lobbying increased penalties for petty crimes
and their crippled language will never go much farther
and their speed should be capped at 56k before that
and then career in software engineering?
and then career in software engineering?no
and then have another team who spam all over social media with hundreds of sockpuppet accounts.
and then they'd spend a bunch of money on servicenow and have no idea how to make any use of it at all, and then they'd spend more money hiring our company to run their instances for them and customize that pile of crap to deal with their retarded business rules.
and then they'll claim fagple invented and discovered folding phones and were the first to the market and then everyone clapped
and then you woke up
and then, and then what else does xbox got?
and there are python wrappers for r ggplot so there's no point of using anything else for plotting>muh matlabi'm not trusting any number crunching task to closed source software that somehow has become slower than python
and there are still people that use this os?
and there's a good correlation with computer geeks and weebs so yeah
and there's always thing sort of thing going on:> please note that auto-contribute is enabled by default when you start using brave rewards
and there's any interesting research on this issue?
and there's nothing stopping other chrom* builders from keeping manifest v2 for backwards compatibility with ub0, as brave, vivaldi and ug chromium maintainers have stated.
and they are also very incompetent
and they buy it then log into their google account from a foreign ip and nothing changes in terms of their privacy.then there's people who use proxies/vpns as a way to do petty crimes without much chance of ever getting a letter from their isp.the first group just helps to fund the activities of the latter and of the provider, for the most part.
and they can't figure out what it is
and they get annoyed by the rest 95 developers with useless meetings and modern bs like pair programming etc
and they have like couple thousand hackers ready for war at any moment.sorry if this came off like dumb vs thread which i assume may not be embraced here
and they were uneducated like the schoolbook tells me!!!11111!!!1
and they're all modded
and they're niche at best in the hpc world
and they’ll mostly comply.in us you’re absolutely fucked.
and third party ink cartridges for it are cheap and plentiful.
and this >>77049318
and this is even better since mobile phone will be free of wires and you just keep dap in pocket
and this is why you're less than 1% of the global userbase and are still delusional thinking it has to do with your taste.2010-2014 was the era when phones were literally press random to get features
and this time, they're really trying hard to make it impossible for independant repair (including the person who bought the device) to obtain any compatible parts and even if, they're making it so the changed part needs to be authorized via an apple issued special software with a unique private key.fuck this company.
and those are the same people that usually complain how bad windows is and how everything is slow even though they paid as much as 600 for their piece of shit laptop.
and tick the box that says to delete the folder after archiving>it fucking works, the folder is deleted >fucking winrar of all things managed to fucking fix something for me one of the most powerful tools at my disposal wasn't able to
and to think you had to use vms before.
and to who?
and tor kept his business completely secure, what are you implying?
and toying with vms
and under 130 - the cheaper, the better.
and unlike pnggauntlet, it has been updated in the last 9 years.
and use something like ipod touch like a regular phone but without it screaming into botnet every second
and was it just laying around untouched for these 6 days?
and we'll just throw your old computer away!
and what are they moving to?
and what comes after gen z?
and what could be more direct than pointing straight to where you want thecursor to go, or where your selection should begin and end?
and what email was used for the account?
and what is bagging going to do to help me?
and what is wrong with that
and what makes me safe is the following: my right to bear arms and living in the middle of the suburbs, where undesirables are locked out due to social credit.
and what sound cards or dacs can do object-based audio decoding?
and what would be the command line to send to
and what’s its version?
and when did saving money become a bad thing?
and when he tried to profit off the blm garbage, it just proved he has no integrity.
and which distro lets me use the oldest packages available ?
and which language is that?
and which ones are decently sized, perfectly it would be 12inch screen so something can be seen under my cock, thanks.
and which should be thrown straight to tech trash?
and while that isn't exactly a compliment, consider that she sounds just as smart
and who makes the worst?
and why
and why is that a prob-oh what am i saying?
and why is there no good place to discuss technology?
and why isn't there a test environment to check these commits?
and why would you use noscript?
and why?
and will seek revenge.
and with auto brightness outside all the time which pushes even further than max brightness?
and with some of these enclosures, you get janky, loose-fitting cables that you may need to spend more money to replace which would cost you $10-20 for a good one and not just a chinese amazon cable that is the same as the original
and with the exhaust i have up top those three fans don't do much anymore.
and without fail, the 1st time he opened his start menu in front of me, i saw 'candy crush friends'
and worse if they do stay they think i'm weird since i blocked google ip's in my host file and we can't even watch youtube
and writing lisp?
and xiaomi has multiple phones with motorized pop up cameras, so you don't have to deal with a hole in your screen.
and yeah i could learn any of those if i needed to but like i said i can pick up things as i go fairly easily (pretty much self-taught)
and yeah, i need some advice on what i should choose as my server rack thing
and yes i have used it and seen the difference.
and yes, that is with following their usage guidelines
and yet chromium is still faster, you can test it yourself
and yet each year millions of people worldwide salivate at the idea of winning an h1b and leaving their shithole country of origin.the usa isn't perfect but it's leagues better than india.
and yet here we are.
and yet i see people unironcially saying how they hope to pick up some 1080s after rtx 3000 series drops
and you are probably thinking of mammals when you refer to all animals because they are genetically closer to us and thus behave somewhat more like we do.
and you can use whatever language.
and you could share (secured) with online friends.
and you get more cores.
and you have to be poor to be able to use it
and you have to kiss his ass while you barely understand what he’s saying
and you keep bringing up different issues so fast you're not giving me any chance to respond to them!
and you must must must (!) have a pressure relief valve or dimple on these tanks that has access to the atmosphere
and you need this to work in the a very hot messy environment.
and you probably have some interpolation when you fall between multiple values.so mostly the computing demands should be quite simple since you aren't doing big calculations
and you're a disgusting pedophile that should jump off the nearest roof
and you're resetting ram sticks and running a windows repair gui, you're not aligning missiles, you can spare the kid some attention.
and you're wasting your time, whatever dumb stuff you come up with i probably wouldn't agree withwhy does he think it's ok to insult others and tell them to fuck off if he acts like a snowflake if anyone disgrees with him?
and you're welcome, i had heard of fzf but didn't have the guts to try it, and now it seems to be pretty good
and you've never seen boost's source code up close
and your back will be unhappy as well
and your idea is...?
and your shitty phone will be slowed down to death with the only update it will ever get
and, dare i say, the best software ever written.
and?
and?toobs are for fun
android 10 lets you do this
android apps?
android is a version of linux
android is botnet itself,that's why it needs third party applications.
android is linux tho...
android is superior in every way and apple can't even make shit not look blurry and fuzzy as fucking shit
android one?
android sucked until 4.4, then it started sucking but in a different way>>77054210u ok my man?>>77054917lg skin was always ugly and they always sucked at battery life, but yeah, they made some good looking ones
anecdotally, i have an older amd gpu with a first gen ryzen, and i don't get any stutters in any game for any reason
anecdotally, it was veeeeery sluggish compared to the arch install i have on my laptop now

another example is mapbox, they have good relations with them so mapbox can do pretty much whatever with osm data too.all in all, the osm board is filled with leftist retards
another faggot filtered ;)
another good standard was accepted and implemented in big 3 compilers.
another one even made the joke of having pre-filled toe tags with cause of death as covid because even traumatic asphyxiations were caused by the big rona.
another one is gtkcord (but i'm not sure if that one supports voice calls or chats).
another one is stress testing my 150w cpu with the vrm cooler fans disconnected (the vrm cooler is about 1.5 packs of gum sized) after 5min the pc shut-off.
another question then: sandisk vs samsung micro sd??
another stark reminder of what i'm missing out on
another thing which is likely due to my lack of knowledge is compiling suckless software just doesn’t seem to work for me even after changing the paths as recommended
another try:vr game dev under 1k price, wifi, keyboard in hand

arm chips are cheap and used in virtually everything from smartphones to programmable mice
arm is closed due to there being no standard of ipling the chip and no standard way of booting an os
arm is much worse off then x86 until (if they ever) standardize ipling the fucking thing
arm is very much designed for the industry that uses it, its rather unfriendly to end users who just want to boot whatever code they want, which is fairly trivial to do on an ibm compatible.
arm macs are going to have a such a ridiculous advantage over every other laptop and desktop it isn't even funny.
arm originated in desktop pcs, based retard.
arma had a port, but you could only play with other linux players

back in 2014 the only widely available android mid-range/budget phone that wasn't pure trash was the moto g, and it had been recently launched, so no one knew how good support was going to be or how long lasting it would be i think he does his research

backports can only contain so many things and flatpaks are limited(plus i'm not a huge fan of flatpaks/snaps/appimages, i only use them if there's no other way i can get a program running).with all this mind, fedora or arch?

bare metal installs of anything you don't have to bare metal install for performance (gaymen) reasons are silly when you can do much more otherwise in vms including snapshotting, copying the entire vm as backup or for transplant to other pcs, etc and they're especially useful for linux since you can download prebuilt vms from a variety of sources while distro churning to find the most homosexual stupid childish desktop possible.

besides 4chanx, what scripts does /g/ use?
besides despite all the stupid shit cluttering up /v/ there was still a fair amount of discussion instead of making new boards the jannies just need to actually do their damn jobs.
besides it isn't solely used for movies i use it for backups too if that's more to your liking.
besides saving you a few clicks, minibin may also come handy when you are hiding the recycle bin from your desktop or if you are using a replacement shell that provides a system tray but no usable or customizable recycle bin.
besides the atm unit cameras, on the airport cameras where like control this.later was at a house and barely even mention cameras as i didnt say anything and a flag goes off so i get up for a meeting while the house is checking me out like im fit or in trouble then person asked to speak with was in a meeting and the dude at the door was like shutting it off so this team monitoring read a book that i read and casually goes like we tapped the entire house so this house was like state of the art protected with the entire grid of the surrounding area to verify if its tapped to avoid being tapped so they start putting the heat on me then the second outfit shows up and goes casually we're tapping too so they tapped them both and then i was asked : are you schooling us?that's the anecdote besides i can't say a date because maybe you shouldn't ask that question and not yours in my life.
besides the gnome foundation only pays one real developer.btw here's a small challenge for anyone interested
besides the sub-par battery life on the 4, it will still get android 13, so i feel like it doesn't make sense to switch to a pixel 5 only after a year.>>77066343>>77066421i'm just thinking of the fingerprint sensor because of covid.
besides the xperia 10 ii, are there any other midrange with a proper ultra wide + telephoto camera setup?
besides which i am paranoid about actual housefires and a space heater powerful enough to make a difference is one of the leading causes of actual literal electric fires
besides which that doesn't fix my fucking problem of paying more for electric heat in the winter and now you're adding the cost of that useless device on top of it.yeah nah cunt
besides, he's super egotistic and that's very annoying.
besides, i hit control_l ten times more often than fn, so it makes sense to remap.
best bet is to ask on /vr/
best bet is to find a nice second hand laptopyou'd be surprised what people get rid ofclip related, i got this laptop for free, nada, nothing at allthe game is running on all low, 640x360, but it is a business laptop with integrated graphics, so what can you do?also, you better believe you'll need to sacrifice video quality, not even a $400 desktop with new parts will run games like these beautifully

best indipendent android app stores?
best keyboard for long typing/coding sessions?
best korea
best music tag editor for gnu/linux(gnu+linux)?

best of all, mpv.net has more features and better performance than regular mpv.
best one is a fisher studio standard, they made a real ladder dac out of resistors for the first few models
best open back for natural sounding vocals and instruments, with nice soundstage and separation under $700?

better price perf for me would mean amd costing 150/200 dollars less than nvidia.
better productivity, the same for 144hz gaming
better talking to retards than just listening/reading from them
better than any uni class i've ever taken.https://www.cprogramming.com/then read up on basic data types/structures like linked lists and shit and then some basic fucking algorithms.
better than being a weaboo lmfaoo
better than having it be inside %appdata%just kidding lol they put stuff in both places and leave it when you uninstall
better than having people making threads about it, you've seen it, it's getting bad
better than libreoffice.
better than seeing 200mb of js just to load a 20mb jpgs on slider
better than snap
better to force you into a more expensive phone contract that comes bundled with the phone.
better to keep that to yourself if you look white or people will secretly wonder if your grandpa was a nazi
better to make it so there is less mess and collect insurance and maybe buy even better products
better to wait until it's actually useful which won't happen for another 3 years least.
better wait a few more months to see if anything worth buying, then buy a 1080ti if nothing interest you.
better?

bitcoin can be worth whatever, good luck using it for anything real, or converting it into real cash.
bitlocker has (iirc) only two basic algorithms, both of which map onto (modern) processor's instruction set, so it's fast as fuck.if you just used plain xts-aes on vc, it'd be pretty snappy too.
bitlocker is meant to encrypt the drive and protect data on it, not to protect the laptop against being stolen.

both apploo and poosoft have 30% performance hit, armshit wont magically run x86 faster
both are free if you are a pirate.
both are gnu/linux distros
both are shit
both are still better than whatsapp, especially after the recent webapp exploit.i'll probably switch to xmpp-based messaging when i have a proper idea of how the protocol works.
both are worthless at 720p.
both being under a foss license, they can not stop end-users from using zfs as a product that compliments their linux distro, any more than nvidia can stop people from using their proprietary drivers.
both emacs and vim bindings have some level to rationalization to them and neither is really hugely inferior to the other
both for the reason that pressurized hard shell vessels burst more excitingly than soft shell vessels but also because you want to allow room for the tank to expand and contract with changes in temperature
both frames are already rendered at this point
both have great examples of properly packaged versions with no issues, both have broken applications with weird issues
both have shit software out of the box but are easily tweaked
both linux, windows, mac and bsd are shit, so they are almost the same thing.
both memes that won't lastespecially risc-v
both nvidia and amd are fucking shit.
both of them follow the modern trends and have leds
both of these are really old and check another hipster vintage faggot box
both of these linux distros lack a gui, and you have to set it up manually for productivity and comfort.i assume then, what you meant to ask was>should i go for a debian or centos based distro for (...)by debian based, i assume you mean like ubuntu or mint
both of those are pretty solid from what i hear.
both options suck.
both phones are going through development phases
both pretty shit directors but no, hackers is pretty technical where it isn't replacing hours of staring at terminals with floating meaningless symbols
both refer to the state of being controlled by or being in control of somethingfucking look at this tho - https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/5bde2954c180034a27b079acaff46073dc75139b

businesses are building large applications in python and in that role it sucks..
businesses are more concerned with results, but some bots posting threads on /v/ gets gaymers buying amd.
but 2004 i imagine won't come for a while given that they haven't even fully rolled it out through windows update yet.
but 50% capacity is a good place to be.anyway yeah i've noticed that most people skimp out on the psu
but a mouthbreather wouldn't know.
but according to suckless.org vim rocks and if it doesn't introduce relatively huge amounts of complexity to something as simple and straightforward as a text editor, then i don't know what does
but ak might be cold enough to freeze underground anyways

but at home, speakers it is.also you seem focused on gaming, i barely game on my pc anymore, i have various cheap consoles plugged to the tv for my favourite games, half of them quite old
but at least i know i'm not being spied on by my machine when i don't have my web browser open, and i'm not using harmful software.
but at least microshit doesn't fuck with your config after you're done.)
but at least their economy won't take as big a hit as the other countries which can lead to many more deaths.

but don't worry, america is dying in fire rn
but dude...
but even then, the burnout from my course makes it hard to be passionate about bothering with any side projects that could go on a resume, i'm just sick of it.
but even then, you can use aac which is still better than mp3.
but every community has a hivemind
but films and games already sound like dogshit and people genuinely wouldn't notice, especially braindead retards that play mobile gamest
but first impressions, this is the first harman tuned iem i actually enjoy
but for anything high res definitely prefer a nice grille, granblue versus for example looks really good on my trinitron
but for shell functions or script names you have to pick a poison
but for the most part it is similar all over the world
but for the rest, it's a net economic benefit and societal benefit to start capitalizing on all that open space
but fuck me, that might be more soul crushing than remaining software lead.
but grub is smart and will add a reference to itself to the gpt header of your sdb as primary boot loader anyway.good that's what i want
but hap ac2 has a working openwrt build anon.
but he also said there is tactile feedback, how does that work???
but he could be worse: he could be like bill gates.
but he is a retard, thinks its his eyes and spreads misinformation.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9n8hz_rlqw&t=222son a crt testufo looks perfect, you can make eye contact with it no effort
but hey, atleast you can reuse the fans :)i can atleast respect the effort custom loopers put into their system, if you're defending aio's you're nothing but a consooming faggot.
but hey, it's the distro i go to when i actually want to get something done on linux.
but hopefully it's a net good like >>77101774 was saying.https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization
but how would you create a centralized repo that works across several distributions, without having to cater to each distro's special quirks and policies?
but i acknowledge that for a server this would be hell.
but i also ban ip ranges so i doubt these messages have ever done anything but amuse me desu
but i also partly agree, i should probably let this go.
but i also want 144hz gaming since i got a monitor for that
but i am a poorfag
but i am the resident jetbrains shill, love their ides
but i am you
but i bought the b450 2 years ago its not fair
but i can't seem to stop color scheme hopping.
but i do agree on the fact oc is very much down in recent years
but i do am making 400k a year
but i do want to be able to run games on life support like modded to fuck morrowind which are not at all optimized.
but i don't care because emacs is just too comfy.
but i don't have a job
but i don't know how to stop
but i don't mind using software mods to emulate a notch.will the pixel 4a have this kind of ability baked in?
but i don't want to buy a 3400g if i can get an 8c/16t apu pretty soon
but i find the user-friendly features sort of make me understand the system less.i'm planning to play around with a few different distros on an old macbook to get a feel for what i like before deciding if i'll migrate my main windows machine over.
but i guess it'd work.also try podman, lxd or even kubernetes
but i guess since he is not black it's not taken into consideration
but i had nothing to do with him leaving.i guess he always just wanted mpv to be *his* project where he could reign freely
but i know some girls who can actually code
but i may be wrong, do your research but i wouldn't get a 3axl with 4a and 5 around the corner.i have a 3axl myself, it's a lot better than my homo g.
but i mean real implementations out of in the market.
but i really dont want to waste my time trying to find a solution for the audio and video playback that dont work.i also couldnt run the binaries in my linux ext4 partition even though i installed the necessary libraries and the compatbility package
but i wanna use em>>77400965thanks anon :)>>77400850no
but i was pretty early on it.
but i work in software not hardware dose not matter the os checks for some hardware replacements and prevents them from working(the screen)
but i'd wager it's usable.
but i'm interested.also i know its western website, they will be biased and exposed to their own shit better so i know it's not perfect place to ask if i want objective answers but i think this board dont care about politics like /pol/ enough to know rival country shit is better and not admit it.i think i came off kinda prochina and no i am not using proxy and i am not chinese
but i'm not sure if i'm selling them to a retard get's accepted as justification by ripe.
but i'm still so overwhelmed with what i don't know that i'm not sure where my goals should be for my abilities right now.
but i've already seen hidamari sketch

but if true, apple has a huge fucking win here.
but if you actually have the know-how or motivation to learn how to properly operate an irix machine, go for it anyway
but if you can build a city from scratch, you have an incentive to finish, because the completed product would have people move in and start generating new revenue streams, services, and create wear and tear in that infrastructure
but if you can't accept the fragility of the human condition on your own, maybe meds could unironically help you out.
but if you don't care about things exiting cleanly and just want the system down, you should just cut off power instead
but if you have the money and you like it, there's no problem.same with chairs
but if you must go for the bigger is better thing why not say hell with 43 and get a nice 65 instead.
but if you want overkill and have the cash then go for it.what do you plan to use the watch for?
but if you're running dos games on an older system you're often using msdos even today
but if your router uses isp specific options like vlan stuff and username/password stuff then it probably wont work

but in terms of maximum subjective flatness, yes, that is what i eq to...which generally involves a fuckload of filters.
but instead of making innovative games they are just making low quality cash cow busy games

but it has a 60 in the name!
but it honestly depends.
but it is not absolutely necessary
but it is porn though
but it is portable.
but it is weird how it went from requiring one or either to strictly a phone number like that
but it might still be worth a read.
but it will get better as you replace more components right?
but it would be a major undertaking.
but it would last you a decade.
but it'll just come back on randomly and delete it again though
but it's currently being rewritten
but it's increasingly heading that way, which is why apps and services are garbage now
but it's not likely to happen
but it's still relatively new right?
but it's true though
but its literally notcope harder

but now amd does it as well.
but now i can say > i am going to make itand really truly believe it.
but now in 2020 it seems the vibe is completely different.
but now skimming through and it seems it's worth reading at least from a technical standpoint.>>77042217every board uses cookie based ids, whether visible or not.
but now that canonical is forcing snaps to be a thing, i think its time to say no thank you to all variations of poobuntu
but now that i've revealed my goal, you should probably just ignore this thread and let it die or be killed by jannies since /g/ isn't for consumer questions.
but now the real question is where the fuck you find good telegram groups or channels.
but now their xray machines have gotten enough better that they can see everything they need to from that
but now, obviously, i work on a windows machine, and windows just will not let you de-install a solitaire program
but nvidia's is on another scale entirely.
but obviously that would've been mistake, evidenced by all of intel's vulnerabilities.
but ok, let's give a credit; you can do content management
but on balance it's still a win.
but once they are known to be acceptable i dont usually monitor them.

but please enlighten me
but plex organizes my media instead of just looking at files.
but pros are that sftp literally just wekrs everywhere.
but psus aren't 100% efficient
but rather than using its empire of global power to usher in a golden age of exceptional technology, gates' microsoft contently shoved out shitty software designed to be good enough to run low-end hardware, launching the era of for dummies books that tried to make sense of a dark generation of garbage technology that promised far more than it ever delivered.https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/30/editorial-no-bill-gates-windows-was-not-iphones-natural-nemesis
but rather, there being no reason it wouldn't run on sandy bridge
but really, any serious mobile gaming industry died in 2013/14, you can count on fingers the amount of non gacha aaa's released since then, and they are often just downgraded console ports.
but retrobrite is only good for resellers.
but right now nobody is stopping you from making a blog to voice your shitty opinions on, and nothing is stopping people from going to it
but school keeps ruining my schedule.>>78483583ne?
but separate the name itself from the language.>names like zig sound like the name of a villain in a 80s cartoon for children.people could come up with dumb comments like this for any lang.just responding to your posts makes my brain hurt, so unless you have something decent to say, i'm probably done after this.
but seriously there are people out there who take pride in the fact they've been propagandized into retarded brand loyalty fueling some shitty duopoly.
but since most shitty jewish javascripts wont work on it either way that's not a problem.
but stepping through your code and watching variables is infinitely easier

but systemd isn't going to replace openrc or runit anyways
but teh spyware...
but thanks for letting me know so i can add support to my theme
but that just seems like it would muddy up the water by having competing standards in the same project.
but that never happened and the bet on fx's many weaker cores ended up being a really fucking bad bet.
but that's haskell for you, thats the way they roll.
but that's not gentoo
but that's not going to help you draw something that doesn't suck.
but thats how he gets his views
but thats not the issue here
but the boards themselves?
but the company who made the building has been making buildings for the it industry for over 25 years....apparantly they are not very good at it.
but the desktop app is electron garbage so it runs equally shitty
but the fastest i can run them is 2133mhz
but the instance i use ( https://invidious.snopyta.org/ ) is now kinda slow
but the iphone is the better choice if you're getting it for free
but the most vivid is the issue with pg_logical, replication software for postgres
but the result is what i wanted.
but the shit gets worse
but their file manager has had previews for ages, no?
but their implementation is usually garbage in multiple ways because they're often not even mainly designed to serve the machine's owner in the way pers chooses.
but then again these fuckers are getting old...or last i could get a new drive for my laptop but it's old and shitty so it might not be worthy at all.what do you guys think?
but then i booted up in safe mode on my primary pc and everything was working fine again
but then i keep all the nonessentials like wifi, bluetooth, gps, etc
but then make sure your d eal er on tor is legit
but then people wanted it to be indexed and searchable, and then certain sites got to be popular gathering places (including this one), and a decentralized system became centralized
but then the 980ti came out and it was all over from there.
but then why get a shitty gimmicky full suspension bike to begin with?
but there are minor differences including:physical sizetypes of outputsnumber/quality of fansrgb if thats your thingpre-over clockedim sure theres others but it makes it hard to tell whats actually better.
but there are no c++ jobs, and the few jobs that require c++ require a super high level of c++ knowledge
but there are russkies contributing to the project regardless.
but there is another way to open this lock
but there is no way i can get a static ip, dynip is not really good desu
but there's stuff i need to hide
but there's tons of courses and books and language implementation.all in all it's a nice package and good for beginning to intermediate programmers
but there’s only one server implementation that matters, whereas wayland has a bunch of different compositors, all with different ideas of what they should and shouldn’t support, and most of them very incomplete.maybe things will turn out alright in a few years, but i wouldn’t get my hopes up.
but they don't
but they don't have anywhere near the detail, separation, etc
but they don't.
but they just keep asking more for the same parts
but they still plan to implement a paid for version eventually
but they'll happily go out for a meal and blow hundreds of dollars there instead (no tip).1k phones are for early adopters or middle income posturers, not actual rich people.
but they're fun
but they're really powerful if you want to spend the time getting used to them
but they're shit
but they're so cheap and replaceable, might as well hire 5000 to build your app for 20c/hr.
but they're were people alive to both watch the wright bros first flight and the first man on the moon
but this is like i said only a speculation on my side.i got my hands on 4 brand new vega vii gpus and if i decide to keep them i have to pay up 2800$ for all of them

but we need macs for the ios support which you cannot get on windows or linux
but what css topic should i learn?

but what vendors will sell you a hundred of them?
but what's the second most trans language?
but when i try to login as an admin, the password i setup is no longer working
but why is a pi a quarter of a year
but why is someone with years of experience applying for a role where one of the questions is find all the odd numbers between 1 and 100
but why make simple and clean when you can do complicated shit
but why should i?
but why would i want to?
but with aurora you can use root to auto install
but wouldn't you actually be walking around in real space too though?
but yea us gov and military certainly would not give out compromised software only they can hack they'd never do something like that right?literally a hello world by lennart/red hat should be considered highly malicious.
but yeah you've got me worried about dust now.
but you are a loser
but you are making quite the assumption here
but you can do it under any of these.
but you can make something better right?https://gitgud.io/skekorton/4chanxti need some developers who know java?
but you can offer the counterpoint that while technology has increased suffering in some ways, it has reduced it in others
but you can pay people to do your assignment.
but you can use wms and have le ebin cli installs with anything nowadays, even with ubuntu.
but you could also get a used z87 for cheap to replace and hold you over until am5.
but you could just compile a program that prints out firewall crashed
but you didn't even listed free linux.
but you don't
but you like google and your spy agencies?
but you need to wash your hands before..
but you said rendering 600fps was dumb with a 60fps monitor, seemly not getting the point.
but you should've bought smarter
but you want the calculations to take a very consistent amount of time, so you can be ready for each stroke and not run out of time
but you will always be a stranger in another country
but you will come up with excuses as to why your piece of shit software is shit
but you won't really particularly see any difference in the low res / low framerate vhs video.maybe future ai interpolation / upscaling can clean up archival quality vhs grabs in lossless av1 marginally better, but this seems excessive for how little information is on vhs; you'd be better off putting that effort into getting locating the original copies of said war footage
but you would struggle to get past that if you aren't an engineer or if you don't have very specialized knowledge gained over years.
but you're a wojakposting subhuman too.
but you're also a massive asshole

buy a sparkfun inventor's kit, comes with a guide and bits to learn arduino (c with some extra shit), once you've got through that you'll have a general idea of how to move forwards, build shit based on arduino for as long as you want, every little project idea you have try to do it, or just buy sensors and peripherals, try to hook them up by themselves, then try to use multiple at once, build up your skills as you can.once you've done all that shit, you can try something like the moto mod kit, but another option is grab autodesk eagle and start learning how to design pcb's yourself, and either have them fully manufactured in china, or order the raw boards and populate them yourself.pretty easy, you can just look up the schematics and design files for virtually everything on sparkfun, copy that and recreate it in your own pcb's.by then, you'll know how to move yourself forwards however you want.

c
c already exists
c and c++ programs are only small because they can dynamically link against the standard library that is already installed on the system for historic reasons (or installed via visual c redistributables along with the program on windows)the rust standard library isn't typically installed on systems, so they have to statically link everything into the executable.
c and lua
c beat out python, javascript and c++ in the tiobe index.visual basic beat javascript.scratch higher than rust.the tiobe index is a joke
c has a div function to get both of these values without having to do both division and modulo
c has runtime too, no less than rust.
c includes are preprocessor directives prefixed by #also <18h would most likely be some weird bullshit macro if it could ever compile.
c is literally the best general programming language
c is pretty easy to pick up if you have an iq of at least 80

c was the standard in 1969 and it will be the standard in 2069

c++ first is goodyou get to try both relatively low level shit and oop, which is pretty much the metalater most of the other languages feels like c++ with missing features or with new time-saving features
c++ if you want a job
c++ is legit too for games
c++ proficiency does not equate c proficiency, so do not assume you have the latter if you have the former
c++ programmer hereredpill me on rust
c++ should be the only language used and libraries should be created for each use case to make writing code easy
c++ was my first as well.i had a great teacher and it worked out very well for me because i actually understood things by the time i left community college that my classmates in uni did not (because they were all java and python fags)what are you in for?it depends on how you're being taught.if you're being taught to write c with some extra crap on top then your teacher is an imbecile and you're going to have a hard time.if you're being taught modern c++ then that's good

chrome uses kdialog, cuz they implemented kde integration before xdg portal existed (way back in 2011).
chromebook.
chromium devs often push in functionality no one wants because herr google demands it
chromium does support dns over https (doh) and the only reason it still lacks encrypted sni is cause it's still a draft:https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esniso as soon as encrypted sni stops being a draft or at least reduce the open issues and achieve a feature freeze it will be implemented on chrom*as for what's better, use whatever you like most, if you want something that just works and doesn't send telemetry use ungoogle, if you don't mind the extra work and want a little bit more customization use firefox just remember to:>disable all telemetrynot just the options but use an additional user.js file and pray god for it not sending information anyway>remember not to use extensions that injects content on the sitethis is pretty much anything that show a panel/content on or over the site that is not the normal panel on the extension icon or the sidebar api, cause aside of the panel and sidebar api the rest will leak info or even an unique id to the site cause webextensions are shit and mozilla doesn't want to fix the bug.
chromium is the official open source version of chrome from googlehttps://www.chromium.org/ungoogled chromium (the fork of chromium that op is talking about specifically) is just chromium with all the telemetry/spyware (yes, all of it) removed and maximum privacy settings on.https://github.com/eloston/ungoogled-chromiumbut since chromium itself is open source (which allow for ungoogled) there are forks of it with malware packed inside of it that certain viruses autoinstall to trick the user into thinking is just chrome and so they will use it

co-worker has been using w2ui for one of our web projectsit's no longer supported since 2015 or so, but the whole concept of w2ui is that you can define a whole interface in json, meaning instead of writing hundreds of almost identical files with different database queries to populate grids and whatnot, you make 1 template file which loads in the json from a database for each of those 100 different interfaces.no need to redeploy the whole web application to add more views or fix bugs.now we there's a new web project on the horizon and somehow i'm forced to do it.on one hand we can't use w2ui anymore because it's dead, on the other hand co-worker wants me to find a solution that works just like w2ui, aka everything configured in the database.i'm seriously considering telling them to fuck off since i come from a c++ / c# background and i don't want to deal with webdev.what do?

covid has been hitting my side hustle hard.it seems like no one has disposable income right now so i move less items than i did a few months ago, which means people are not usually in the market for a generation old macbook pro, dell precision, hp pro book, or whatever higher end laptops i'm able to get in bulk from an off lease status or from a closing down business in the area.i'm mostly moving items that sell under 80 bucks or so right now

debian
debian and fedora are the only two distros that i've ever used which broke itself after an update
debian and ubuntu broke too and all their derivates, this was a big fuckup
debian for sure (see: ian murdock)
debian gives you option not to, and probe your hardware for which drivers to install
debian gnu/linux because it's good.
debian gnu/linuxnone really, though i tried several on secondary disks and vmsdebian gnu/linux
debian has a stupidly strict definition of stable and it's a meme if you believe them..t linux boomer that's been breaking debian for a long time.
debian in particular is very stable compared to distros like arch
debian is basically the same thing once you download the drivers.
debian is for the orthodoxy (aka boomers) and the base for all buntu deriv's
debian is probably not the optimal kde distro, but it would steal be miles ahead of the bloatnet that is win 10
debian is really for basing other distros on, not to use as a working system
debian is still a text mode installer (i think), which isn't harder but it's more offputting to people
debian like every other modern non-autist distro has fixed package problems 2 decades ago, but they still run into smarmy little elitist users who think they're being smart for fighting the package manager full time
debian maintainers usually say it.
debian makes you do stuff like set up the sudoers file, and requires you to mess with sources.list to get recent software
debian on a home server
debian or fedora.or opensuse too, i suppose
debian user playing with steamvr
debian, meaning that while your package count is lower you actually have more bloat installed.

depending on how original the generated text is, it can fool most teacher's ^c ^v analisys tool
depending on the mouse it may not be an easy process
depending on the window manager, it's underlying architecture and how good you are at shell scripting, kernel compilation, patiently posting in forums and sidestepping passive aggression by works for me neckbeards to elicit a constructive, problem-focused discussion
depending on where i'm going, knife.
depends how much ram and gpu you use it with and if you have an ssd, since browsers will use gpu acceleration for video and for some css.so it's potentially copeable but it will be a noticeably worse experience than even a sandy bridge system.
depends how simple
depends on budget and how important sound quality is to you
depends on how yo start x
depends on if the computer is also running linux or notif it's not then noif it is then yes so long as the drive is mounted
depends on situation
depends on the color of your ram.
depends on the hardware, but i'm not as happy when i see green.yet we both use linux.how cool is that?
depends on the problem, if one of the rams broke, then you only need like 30$ and it's very easy to replace it
depends on what else you put in your pocket
depends on what is the bottleneck.
depends on what the price of new phones is in your country.the note 9 is more capable than most $300 usd phones in america so its not bad to repair it.depending on your country you may be able to get a good chink phone for $300 so that's worth considering.

depends on where you are
depends on your background i guess
depends on your de
depends on your hardware and what modules you use

devops is developers handling things that sys admins used to handle, but in a much more abstracted/automated fashion

devs only bother detecting public cheats, you can get away with anything if you have some basic skill.

different ip for different terminal looks like the best option.>vpn here is the problem its a vpn meaning:a) its system wide and i have no idea how to make it local to a terminal only.all the paranoid shit is really irrelevant to what i need this for.b) i only want to use free vpns since i scrape anonymously(no login no nothing) and the vpn provider can feel free to sell this data(i'm wondering if the guys tell the sellers to go fuck themselves if the try to sell what obviously looks like a automated scraper bot log) since its not illegal so all the system wide paranoid shit is really irrelevant to my needs and only is hindering me.if you can tell me how i can make it local to one terminal i can try to use a vpn however the free ones i feel will vanish or ban me for automated bot use.tor looks like the best option since they don't ban and have shit loads of ips to get.only i don't care for the paranoid shit since what i do is all legal-ish fluff crap

distro diversity is getting smaller and smaller because as more windows users migrate to linux, the shit distros will get smaller and smaller and the good ones will rise to the top
distros don't matter as long as you stick with non meme ones maintained by one person
distros will report bugs and often send patches to you, if you care about writing your program well

each class only provides methods which are appropriate, serversocket has accept(), socket() has connect().under posix, a socket is just a socket until you call either listen() (server-side) or connect() (client-side)
each fedora version last for 1 1/2 years
each floor/section of floor is rented out to different companies
each hardening feature may have an impact to the runtime performance or kernel image size.
each hash is compared to each other
each is different (e.g international is split into continents and countries, politics has ideology subfolders) but they usually have the following subfolders in common:>guides and informationfor infographs, e-books, etc>memesself explanatory>videosfurther subdivided>peoplee.g people related to the area, e.g an rms subfolder in technology
each ms is responsible for storing its own data.once you start to do x-service reporting and data gathering things get messy.
each page takes 5+ seconds to load in waterfox classic.
each time you want to download the best audio (with best video - strange isn't it?) you have to write essay in cmd> open search> write cmd> open cmd> open explorer> find youtube-dl.exe> remember addres> back to cmd> cd navigate to youtube-dl.exe> write youtube-dl -f bestvideo+bestaudio (because it cannot be done by default, right?) /your link/> even after this this piece of garbage downloads separately video to mp4 and audio to webm
each torrent have many seed but all have constant size 14.15 mb, even resident evil 6!
each vega vii has 16gb ddr so i would have a total of 64gb of ram.i also have tried large-model-support but im running into issiues, i will have to get some threadripper with enough pcie lanes and also a powersupply to handle the 4x300w.am i doing a misstake?

ecu is pretty much a giant lookup table.fuel injectors are basically valves controlled by an electromagnet so you send pulses of varying lengths to open them some specific amount for a specific amount of time at a certain point in the engine stroke for each cylinder.so you have a bunch of sensors on the car that tell you things like crank rpm, air flow entering the engine, proportion of oxygen remaining in exhaust etc and probably some more values if the car has a turbo.the ecu has a database of precomputed values that should provide the highest efficiency for some particular combo of these values

either beg around for an internship, or make something that can be published
either following the ceiling skirting, or the floor skirting.
either get a passive sub and speakers with an amplifier (or av receiver) or an active subwoofer with a hpf going to the speakers
either start making friends or get on a path to some kind of degree
either tacits or outemu silent sky
either that, or you've got higher-frequency hearing loss and so audio that's distorted the other way sounds good.
either they have a moment and list with the wrong price or they have completely free subsidized shipping and are charging $0.01 more than their manufacturing costs
either way i know jack shit about the technical side but i want to be as far from business (unless i'm doing nothing and have free time (lol)) as possible

emacs lisp is the most superior language for automation of your workflow.no other language but emacs lisp is suitable for anything anywhere except as something that you use emacs lisp in order to compile to.
emacs lisp is the most useful and the most used.
emacs shouldn't attempt to draw anything over the background by default
emacs works best as a compliment to other programs, but, it's also when accepting that that you realize that's also where it works most poorly

even on the newest hardware, it can still bring a server to its knees without using tons of plugins to cache and optimize queries and even then it varies greatly, which in turn makes you vulnerable to attacks because the more plugins you have the more chances of a vulnerability

even then being so high that you dont feel your worse-than-death torture existence isnt exactly optimistic.having my internal processes being beholden to the same scatterbrained design and lackluster engineering that plagues modern technology isnt exactly desirable either.if praying for salvation is meant literally i doubt god would save those who went against his word so massively that they sought immortality on earth over their natural death

everyday people that use their machine for gaming and common shit, dont need a newer cpu, not even a ryzen, because their 2nd and 3rd gen intels are perfectly fine
everyone already did all the work for you
everyone and their dog are moving to chiplet design for next generation, even fucking intel is daring to do it

everything acer i've ever owned has been solid ass shit
everything by sennheiser is good

everything has already been made.
everything has enormous buttons and too much spacing on plasma, regardless of scaling.
everything has its place
everything has to be filtered through the mainstream press so it's just a repository of their lies
everything has to update because of glibc6 and other core libraries that are known to be problematic.
everything i'm familiar with in that field seems to be some type of digital asset management like adobe bridge which deals with all the file metadata and editing too

everything is permanently glowing from all directions.
everything is really stupid and bad, except for me, and my shitty little projects i write that go nowhere at a hundred miles an hour, i won't show you any of this though
everything is replaced, right down to all sorts of low-level code you don't see as an end user, like the code that loads stuff from your hard drive into ram, the code that turns your monitor on and figures out what pixels to send to it, or even the code that decides what to do -- how to divvy up resources -- when you're running, say, a hundred other programs, but only have, say, sixteen hardware threads
everything is the best but the shape for me.
everything is wrong with it
everything moving to cloud is making re harder to find interesting projects.
everything needs to be nuked
everything outside of generals is either youtube, /v/, or just trash.
everything that apple makes is gay though

everything that is pure optane.
everything was going good until just the last couple days
everything was snappy as well
everything works with code from previous arm generation.there is 64bit ubuntu, manjaro and even unofficial arch, but raspbian is still shit.and bases on 16.04 or some other ancient software.
everything you said is 100% truebut anon i train on these cheap garbage overweight inefficient pieces of crap.i'd rather wear out these $130 walmart bikes than waste mileage on my $1,000 carbon frame bike.

federal government gives you like $600 per week, and your state will give you like $250 or something
federated social media is just censorship with extra stepsinstead of being banned from the service, you're banned from every network on the service

fedora and such have it built into the package manager itself, which picks the best mirrors automatically at runtime
fedora gnoome is really comfy
fedora has more up to date packages than ubuntu.

fedora is infested with busted neckbeard trash like wayland.
fedora is slow to jump to new kernel releases on minor version bumps because they hold a big testing and qa event before to ensure nothing breaks

firefox fork without botnet(no windows builds currently, if you use windows, then use this: https://github.com/muslayev/iceweasel-win64)
firefox is already only like 5% on desktop browsers
firefox is more popular than safari, edge and despite those being installed by default
firefox is pozzed
firefox is shit though.they've been making decisions for a long while now that have just made the browser worse and worse over years
firefox now is fast and top modern browser, everything else is chromium based botnet, just use ff with ubo.
firefox on android phone - because it has extensions working, has sync and as the only browser i've found, it properly handles stylus as mouse pointer (based galaxy note).firefox on gnu/linux notebook - because it can sync bookmarks with android app
firefox on gnu/linuxphones are for fags
firefox or chrome are more bloated than this.
firefox removed the version and ability to use an addon that lets me do that.
firefox used to work too, you know
firefox uses system font rendering, chrom* uses their own font rendering engine.
firefox uses xdg-portal

flatpak doesn't do static linking because it uses ostree as a filesystem abstraction, which gives you per-file deduplication.

flatpak isn't perfect, but imo it's a step in the right direction by allowing devs to target linux in general and users to get the software right from the source

for a basic bitch ryzen build, should i grab these:https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fhpmp6/crucial-ballistix-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3200-memory-bl2k16g32c16u4wor two sets of these:https://pcpartpicker.com/product/njvqqs/crucial-ballistix-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-bl2k8g36c16u4wthe price difference where i live doesn't make much of a difference, but i'm wondering if it's definitely worse to use 4 sticks on a daisy chain layout if they're clocked higher anyways
for a case that large not to be able to fit in an air cooler is disappointing as fuck
for a few years i daily drove a rog gaymen laptop with a 970m and 17 inch display
for a rtos its gonna be a shitty one
for a stable outcome, casette dawg.
for all the anons on this board shitting on gamers willing to spend $1500 on the graphics card alone when the consoles are half that, it bears remembering that you're essentially paying that fat premium to future-proof your setup against many upcoming console gens but also probably against nvidia's own mid-tier rtx cards for two gens probably
for an i5 it feels really expensive
for another list, i have also assembled what i think are some good picks
for any project though, especially something that requires maintanence, it's difficult to actually unplug and mentally recharge
for anyone interested in working on reactos:https://reactos.org/contributing/#paid-jobs>kernel developer>for the reactos kernel and drivers, we are looking for people proficient in c, and it is a big plus if you are proficient in c++ too
for anything serious i use clion and it always saves me so much time, having the pointless stuff done for you saves resources in your head and let's you commit more energy to the task at hand
for audio, as the name implies.
for background, i learned to program via 2 years of free online courses and solo project experience, moving on to open source into several years of professional experience.i decided to watch the lectures after all that and still found them interesting and worth the time
for c/c++ i also installed the ccls package, all of the rest just werked ootb.
for cd is 88khz use 32bit to have safety marge for error correction.
for compiling system level apis
for developing anything its garbage in all senses and introduces a lot of bad habits to new coders as it is very limited in all senses
for example by strings with spaces, by board, or by dates
for example canvas, audio context, webgl, and font fingerprints?
for example i made a little cute terminal and it's just fun when it works and that motivated me to add more functionality
for example i sent images of my face multiple times, got my personal information revealed in leaks/dumps multiple times, got scammed, used google, instagram, facebook, etc.is there any way to clean up the past mistakes and is it even worth trying to focus more on privacy now?
for example most msi laptops, like why cant i just have a functionalist, productivity focused machine?
for example take a look at this onehttps://gitlab.gnome.org/gnome/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/1139which tries to introduce some dash to dock functionality into shell
for example, 3 and 6 are confirmed to be parking meters and the ai knows that i'm not bullshitting and when i check 9, it adds the info that 9 will probably a parking meter but it will ask many other users if it is true.
for example, a 500w 80+ bronze psu will draw about 610w to supply 500w

for example, disease has far less effect on humanity than it did before modern medicine
for example, i always have my earbuds set pretty quiet, but my car stereo is really quiet so when i'm connected to it via aux, i turn it up pretty loud
for example, smplayer doesn't use the preferred way how mpv is supposed to be used (either via libmpv, or at least via the ipc protocol)
for example, they refuse to embrace teeline shorthand for meme text, so as to prevent ai from reading it

for how long have you been working there?>hardware code (dc) is agnostic while the higher level (drm in your case) stuff is os specificthat shit is interesting.i wish i could learn about graphics hardware, drivers and shit, but i'm too lazy and it doesn't seem too easy to learn for a college dropout...
for instance, apps can’t use nonstandard network socket types or ptrace other processes.limited access to the session d-bus instance - an app can only own its own name on the bus.no access to host services like x11, system d-bus, or pulseaudio.
for instance, changing your user agent to whatever anybody on the latest version of firefox for windows 10 would have shouldn't set off any alarms unless they have some way of figuring out that you're actually on openbsd/linux/android/etc.and if you're not loading ad/tracker resources at all from websites, then unless they have access to the website access logs, you're better off.
for links check the paste.>>77034808hmmm, what build are you running?
for lossy i either go with pngquant, pingo or imagemagick.
for mainframe job, got hired right after college graduation because i knew a guy there
for manga it's more effective to get a b&w ereader and look up the few color pages on a color display.

for me i was looking for a distro that was basically arch but not as rolling release and majaro was perfect for it
for me it always feels like i'm messing up the pomodoro thing by being interrupted and having to stop what i'm doing and talk to someone every 3 minutes.
for me it was something likeidle -> komodo edit -> eclipse -> pycharm -> geany -> kate -> sublime text -> vimthe last two lasted the longest, been unable to use anything else since vim, and i don't even think it's a very good program, but the editing experience is great.i wish there were some good cross-platform editors that don't have a huge learning curve i could recommend to people, but vscode is utter shit and sublime text is good but proprietary
for me it's boomer music
for me it's cdg
for me it's quick picture viewer!
for me it's the dell g5 se with r5 4600h and rx 5600m, the best cheap ($850) gaming laptop

for me, developing software is fun, exciting, even artistic
for me, having to learn new layers with the hhkb in order to access functions i was used to being elsewhere taught me that these layers are fundamentally learnable, and that having control over them might be a really cool capability to have.
for me, ide's shine when you are debugging

for passwords use password_hash and password_verify.alternatively just use laravel and type 'php artisan make:auth' in the console and bam you now have a webapp with user login/registration.
for people that don't like canonical and hate gnome, it's pretty decent.mint is a desktop only distro, they are focused on one thing and one thing only.it gets the job done.

freesync and g sync provide variable refresh rate synced up with the fps of your gpu.resolution is number of pixels on screen.1080p standard, 4k for high end gaming/content.1440p resolution with 144hz refresh rate is the sweet spot in my opinion.nits stand for brightness, around 250-300 is fine
freesync is a clown fiesta.

game idea:mainly for smartphones game real time 2d mage duel pixel style with tonns of different magic and spells but in order to cast a spell player has to draw something on touchscreen, like runes or something, the faster the player and the more complicated his choice of the spell is the more damage he dealsalso may be add an ability to see what your enemy is drawing as well so if you managed to memorize some spells you can start casting a deflection spell or shield or simply copy the enemy's spell you will also be able to buy shit in the shop for game money or for real moneys that will make it for you easier to cast a spell, may be less lines to draw or something like that

general rule of thumb; job hop after your first job in 1 year, and then your second job 3 years, then 5 years, etc etc
general stuff>not free as in freedom>not free as in free beer>market share of 90+% only because of illegal vendor deals in the late 80s and throughout the 90s>market share is only kept because it's established now and not because it's a good os>microsoft actively tries to embrace, extend, extinguish other oses, applications and services>older, but still supported versions don't receive feature upgrades (drivers, dx12, etc.)privacy>spies on its users>tries to trick users into creating an online microsoft account>gathers telemetry data even if you deactivate it in the settings menu>every app that comes with a standard install has telemetry built into it>start menu and windows explorer include ads>microsoft has published usage statistics of edge and other ms apps>they performed intrusive tactics to make people upgrade their old systems to windows 10speed, stability and reliability>slower in almost every task compared to linux and various bsds (hence its irrelevance for servers)>severe flaws in cpu and i/o scheduling>blue screens *much* more common than linux kernel panics>crashed/frozen applications can often tear down the whole system>no separation between desktop, window management, file browser and file picker (explorer.exe)installation>no live environment>needs to reboot several times during its slow installation>doesn't come with all necessary drivers out of the box>a bare-bone install takes several dozens of gibs of storage>wipes the efi partition and bootloaders of other oses

gnome devs would probably cringe at this.
gnome didn't make wayland worse, wayland made itself worse by not mandating them.>using d-bus for things that should be wayland protocols.those protocols are optional, they can do whatever the fuck they want
gnome is a sign that you matured as a linux user
gnome is meant for people who dont understand what you are trying to do
gnome is not a linus, hence it's usage also in the bsd's.
gnome is not your circlejerking community
gnome is pozzed?
gnome is pro blm and anti white
gnome is so far gone not even a rewrite from scratch is feasible
gnome on x can't do different per-screen dpi though
gnome os
gnome shell)- doesn't support other libc than glibc- hostile attitude from core developer>useful linkshttps://systemd.io/https://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2020/05/02/0/https://devuan.org/os/init-freedomhttps://without-systemd.frama.wiki/https://nosystemd.org/

government subsidises shipping as well as western trade deals that have been in place for decades while china was basically 3rd world to help their economy, and china has a fucking fit every time it’s talked about removing that help now that china no longer needs it, additionally cheap shit helps them a +1 in their number of transactions
governments also launder money buying expensive equipment for education

hi /g i have been writing an encryption methodi wrote down an encryption algorithm but i could only use it for ascii characters as they only have values of 0-127, this was due i can't have an value above 255 for a single byte, i found a new interesting behaviour of bytes that permits to encrypt utf8 characters that have values of 0-255, that also means i can encrypt pretty much anythingan byte is 8 bits, each bit is a value of 0 or 1and a byte is a value of 0 to 255an method of encryption i'm using an proprietary encryption method, i'm naming it per byte encryptionin this method i will add two byte values together for examplebyte a with a value of: 221byte b with a value of: 121will create an value of 342 which is above 255 limit, this value will be them be subtracted by 256 giving us byte c with a value of 86byte c:86it's seems impossible to knows original byte b's value, but them if we have byte a value we can subtract c from a giving us the value of -135,this value is bellow zero them its going to be adding by 256 giving us back the value of 121 which is byte b original valuei wonder if this encryption method has some weakness, or if it was created before by someone, if both statements before prove negative, i have in my hands my own encryption method lolso pls roast me for this method already existing or for being easy to break lol, or just too slow

higher refresh rate would be much more useful than 4k.
higher speed does not always equal a direct ipc increase.

hirooo where's my e-celeb containment board?
his channel is comfy fuck off i don't care that a bunch of redditfags like it
his contribution to cs as a mathematical science is not negligible though.
his coonsumer oriented approach.
his divine will is unstopabble.i have a plan
his last blog posts are from 2014, the latest of which is about using postgresql on his mac.>>77106930yes, he has pictures of a lady named goldstein at usenix 2001 on his websight.
his look is iconic, everyone knows that red shirt
his needs were gaming and work, when the fuck did that require 32gb?
his newly established government agency, called the poettering patrol and dubbed 'systemd inquisition' by is opposers, started raiding people's homes and checking if they have installed either the new systemd/linuxd os, or a new update to windows and macos, that installs systemd on those operating systems as well.poettering holds linus torvalds' family hostage to force him to integrate systemd into the linux kernel
his only complaint would be that he wasn't the one making decisions.
his story of how he worked his way up through junior and eventually got drafted is pretty good/inspiring>all my edits reverted within minutes, get told it's because there's no sources>mfw i'm literally his fucking family, tried to prove it with my name/location/etc, i'm a direct fucking source>provide newspaper articles, yearbook photos, the fucking rink named after him in my city, etc etc>autist poweruser at wikipedia says 'nope', bans my ip from making edits to wikipedia pageshonestly fuck that place
his tds got serious, poor fella needed to be put on therapy
his tone does not suggest that the 'scientific' way of programming is worse.
his video is long winded but not bad
hisense is the king of budget brands.

honestly i half ass'd it like crazy and just literally wrote shit about i don't see black people in this sector, we need more black people
honestly i haven't tried since i've been just using lib
honestly i just image the disk and dump it on an external drive

honestly this is pretty unexpected considering the fsf is a tranny infected sjw shithole that literally kicked out its founding member just for pc brownie points

howdy g!i'm looking for the most free ereader on the market; no drm, the ability to sideload whichever books or pdfs i want, no dependence on internet/an account (for general use, not for ebook purchase) and a simple transfer protocol
however i did find a hwid spoofer that worked but only for 1 day - from time2win.net but now nothing is working
however i doubt anyone wealthy enough to afford it browses here.
however i still need root for some apps like warden or afwall++ so i cant lock bootloader on my device it will cause bootloop.i also cant put password on twrp and it is kinda useless if you think about it since anyone with usb cable can just flash whatever ramdiskso, there are no options?
however odt lets you normally write text in it so 1 page is basically the icon/screenshot for your file browser thumbnails.the next page is where you can write things in like:>website down for a long time>website is turning to crap nowlike you notice this is more relevant for pirating websites since this is what happens there.this is how i do it.so bookmarklets what do you think of this solution?i know of other solutions that i don't use.
however the dev community around it makes python an amazing language to do a variety of tasks as you can paste together different c libraries that are accessed through the python api and create very powerful tool.in summary python is garbage to learn how to code or to build something nobel but it has a lot of utility through the support that it has gotten
however they also have a video upscaler called video enhance ai which based on the demo videos seems too good to be true https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zne9mq9j6au but im running a test now on this apartment scene from mde and im pretty damn impressed
however we can't just let the gweilos treat us like trash
however, crts offer decided advantages over flat panels, the biggest of which is probably the lack of a native resolution
however, i have recently joined two small trackers in a real niche category
however, i know having 3 separate drives is the standard for video editing and that does make a difference.
however, i never normally have to adjust this manually
however, if the websites are all displayed on a single page, users won’t feel the need to stay locked to one single site
however, in high-level languages, arrays should begin at 1 because when you write foo[n], n is an integer that represents the nth element within the array called foo.arrays that begin at 1 are an abstraction, and abstractions are useful.
however, it is mingw, and since it is an almost abandoned project, you have to deal with some of its disadvantages, which there are few
however, it's one of the more challenging things to acquire on this earth
however, like all things ed touches, it deteriorated and was discontinued.
however, mad respect to gnu guixsd, that distro has everything to be on the path to become the next arch/gentoo, i always said it.
however, master the basics first and work your way up
however, most of the alternatives are too big to pocket or have tiny sensors, this thing punches well above its weight and its definitely worth the asking price
however, my internet at home is slow and spotty, and it is endlessly frustrating that i lose my connection to boxes in the middle of doing them
however, often it does not refresh itself and requires a reboot
however, please note that this is heavily discouraged to run x server as root due to security reasons
however, the airflow is pretty bad
however, they make the pockets look bulky and at times uncomfortable
however, this will require our users to use a logind provider such as elogind or systemd
however, try naming an alternative that isn't unstable as fuck and actually has support.protip: you can't
however, when it was first announced, details about how it would actually work were pretty sparse.
however, you have to specifically enable them to charge you beyond your free $300, and it's not something you could do by accident.

hp butt raped intel for failing to deliver, i think they forced intel to deliver one last revision last year.
hp is the single biggest contributor of e-waste with their shitty printers alone.>hp never ever
hp mfps are a solid investment as long as you buy aftermarket toner which can be ridiculously cheap compared to oem prices
hpg i know, butwhat are my options for adding a crossover to my sub/speakers from my preamp?
hsts tries to tell a user's browser that they must use https always, but they still need to connect to the site at least once before they receive the hsts flag, so they could still be vulnerable the first time they connect
htdp and those courses should be enough to keep you busy for a year
html css js are all disaster zones and a lot of complexity in the biggest browsers is there to make them perform better
html is almost completely gone cause browsers keep deprecating standard 30 year old features to go more for the css way of doing everything
html is so easy that we learned it in elementary school and it pretty much didn't change since then (over 10 years ago)

human brains are wired for very particular thought patterns, with lots of neural shortcuts to make things more efficient
human is not a singular hive mind.
humans can't even do that
humans frequently oversimplify problems into my camp, your camp, and when you provide only one real solution it absolves them of any additional thinking.

i (5’10”, 160lb, tranny) am somehow too thin to use the one at work without additional padding>>77613625they do but poorly
i ...
i 100% believe that linus only keeps him around to make himself physically look better on screen.
i absolutely love pug though
i accidentally donated all my gold and upload on ggnwhat do i do?
i actually cucked and got the blu rays and ripped them
i actually did though.try reading a book or two, that way you'll actually learn things instead of pathetically coping with your incompetence.
i actually don't and never did know anything about perl
i actually follow the protocol and find that it's poorly written and that in several places where it's less poorly written there are multiple serious issues which they somehow did not encounter
i actually had to compress my coom folder to make room for my archival project.
i actually had to use this because linux support for the laptop i bought is hot garbage.it's only ok, sshfs doesn't work on it but most other things seem to be fine if a little slow due to accessing lots of small files over the /mnt/c/nonsense
i actually have a variation of that box in the picture
i actually have an acer chromebook 14 and it's an excellent internet and netflix machine
i actually have money to pay for university shit so no student loans
i actually have the s8 and i regret buying it because it has a locked bootloader that will never be unlocked cause it's too old
i actually like the google ecosystem.i use chromium, i use android, i use google search, docs, maps, play store, and youtube.everything is neat and integrated and is nice the same way apple integrate their products
i actually met a bitch once who took her title of scrum master seriously.
i actually notice a performance boost and the games i've tried run nicely.i've only upgraded the ram so i can run firefox in memory, a virtual machine and a game at the same time without caring i'll run out of memory.
i actually own an xps 15 but i did not buy it because of its looks
i actually own this computer
i actually removed vimium from my browser because at this point i don't have the muscle memory for the keybindings.ymmv, but sometimes i'll open vim to edit a quick file and i get confused about the controls.
i actually thought about buying the new acer spin 5 (2020) for uni
i actually use chrome for work just because i use google office apps.
i actually was offered a teaching position at one of these but didn’t see the emailrip
i actually watched this guy make up an excuse for it and pretend like it was normal for our app to be dependent on an external service.the last project i worked on had spaghetti code in it's core final calculation
i added the ungoogled chromium repo to debian and have had no issues so far.
i addition to being effective it also saves you a lot of time
i agree
i agree on that t460 here, it's just a slab of plastic with expandable functionality through a dock, my company gave me this machine and it is my main machine, the it guy gave me this machine asked me what os i wanted and that's been it, everything just works out of the box had no troubles with it so far
i agree on the love hate of the 8051, at least it was a modern atmel derivative with nice c.
i agree that it would make sense for them to do so, but i'm also far from sure it would be worth the effort, especially given that rosetta is going to be a transitory technology
i agree to an extent.if you're working at a company shitting out 300 office applications per year, then yes, you're just shitting out code and not inventing anything new.if you work at a company working on something interesting and worth the time, then you are almost certainly inventing algorithms because you're working on something new and groundbreaking, not just another invoice management system.
i agree with braces vs if/fi at least
i agree with most points.
i agree with you, but he is talking about compiling the kernel (needed in gentoo) so do not really know what he is talking about
i agree with you, but i had no other options(it was only cables on sale), i was ready to spare 7$ over 4 cables to test things out.well, i will rather not test at all.
i agree, except for the part where you said 10.see, the windows 8.1, unlike 10, can be debotnetted and debloated
i agree, sbcl is the best
i agree, screen > dicksize = no go
i agree, sometimes takes 15 seconds just to open a damn picture
i agree.
i agreed!!
i aim to get a minimum of 60fps
i ain't clickign that shit, nigger
i almost never delete anything so now i'm in the process of sorting over 80.000 images
i already automated my job
i already changed dns to avoid blocks on torrent sites
i already did, i complimented some fag's vw beetle in the parking lot and when he got all happy about i told him his car was gay and he looked like a gay retardhe looked so hurt lmao his lip was shaking
i already expected this and it wil be cost twice the rtx 5700xt.
i already have a pixel 4
i already have good job in aerospace
i already knew all my layers because i used vim before
i already tried the restore via safe mode but it failed
i also agreee that we're all different, some are ready sooner, others later and you have to draw a legal line somewhere to keep children protected, but here we all agree, stallman included
i also considered pulling some docker image to work with.
i also created my own programming language, interpreter and os around this concept
i also didn’t make any claims or disclaims
i also do some literate programming.
i also don't clout chase cause i don't have time but even a dropbox dude was talking about how mangment patted themselves on the back for hiring a tranny and he had to to point out there was only one black man in the entire company lol
i also don't have to update every package just to update one
i also dunno why you need 100 different interfaces, or who is trying to modify them
i also give my friends tilde sites if they want :^)
i also had no idea what script blockers, virustotal, vpns, etc
i also had to add a font .ttf for the icons.https://github.com/mateoss/matter
i also have a few other lens for the sony as well.
i also have a full setup of chromecast audio speakers which worked near-flawlessly with gpm streaming
i also have grundig hi-fi box and telefunken with (oval) alnico drivers
i also have some other app i'm working on which is basically going to be my crown jewel
i also just put it in the original t420 it was in and it boots just fine.
i also meet a guy in first year who told me he browses /sci/
i also never had 1 problem with it
i also permanently removed the photos garbage.
i also preferred the old tora no ana site.
i also preordered the cybertruck only to sell my spot in line
i also removed nemo entirely and replaced it with caja.
i also run it on a non-persistent bootable tails usb.i usually use the laptop at cafes, not at home
i also saw xbox series x unboxing video on youtube, and what immedeately caught my eye was the proclamation on the box that said ”4k 120fps”
i also see amd produce much faster cpus soon
i also suffer the same issue, with a dell p2414h (dvi) and viewsonic vx2758-2kp-mhd (displayport)

i always thought they were used as an extra volume knob, but i'm sure that's not always the case?

i can respond to each one of these different points you've made, but it takes me time!
i can see basic stuff like chips detecting aneurysm threats but as far as cognition goes it's a looong loooong way.i actually believe selective genetics/dna alteration/eugenics will arrive before we have computational unterstanding of the brain and will be able to enhance our brains with electronics.so i'd say 500-1000 years.

i can switch mine off on all my androids
i can take a look at it
i can tell the difference between abs now its like banging chesnuts oh so good.
i can tell you're a freshman because the code you posted is imperative, not object oriented.also, breaking up functionality like that is bad, it obscures the purpose of units of code
i can thank the pathetic jaguar cores of current consoles for the fact that the fx is still usable for almost all big titles
i can think of at least one drawback - i become even easier to fingerprint
i can turn them on in the bios, but i get massive system lag/freezing if i do so and audio stutters from the addon bluetooth/wifi card i installed
i can understand why you would doubt it if you've never been into silicon rumors in the past but it's how things have always been
i can understand your position defending what you believe to be superior and others just ignoring/misinterpreting your arguments, so like i said i get why you didn't really respond in good faith the last time
i can upload 1k movies to ptp in a month if i start now and every one of them would stay almost forever.i just don't want to waste my time.
i can use normal towels and stuff to get dry, but i must not rub, or it will be itchy for an eternity
i can use your old email address to investigate your case and possibly resolve it.do you still have access to your old email address (the one you used to log in)?>>77055788ok, post this info as well.
i can verify that samsung t5 and t7 doesn't fuck around in that regard, you could have it dangle from your computer as you sat on a seesaw and it would stay in place

i can watch videos on firefox but not on mpv; they simply don't play as if i had paused them.

i could have multiple shells and potentially even make the infrastructure for a mini operasting system that runs in the browser
i could never have nostalgia for this kind of shit, in fact, i hate technology more than ever before now.not sure if lgr has nostalgia for that shit because of vidya or because he worked with that crap (maybe i'm confusing with another retro tech fagtuber such as 8bitguy), but even then, when i played with pcs as a kid i mostly remember the trouble i had with games and gpu drivers and vodoo 3dfx and directx shit more than the fun i had with the games

i decided to say fuck it and bought a 32 1080p monitor, i'm 5 feet away from it and have no regret
i defended it when the media claimed he told epstein victims were entirely willing, because he didn't say that.but saying>the arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.what the fuck actually?having sex with children is always wrong, because the adult has advantage over children, just like the owner of proprietary software has advantage over users.you can't say something like this and expect parents will support the fsf with stallman as president.

i designed this system so that nothing would ever surpass about 70 c or so.>>77012296it's done but the inverter broke, lol.>>77021714>just go with a wc setup if you've got this level of autismpumps are far too loud and unreliable.>>77035629i made a video about building this machine way back when.
i developed my own computer which doesn't operate with the usual on/off 0/1 techniques seen in peasant computers
i did
i did a 360° noscope on cod black ops once
i did a bunch of neat university projects, but i'm not sure how to judge how good they are.probably the coolest university project i made was a preemptive multi-threading library for msdos where everything is implemented by hand in pure c++ with asm inserts and minimal use of pre-existing libraries (i ended up using dos.h for placing my custom interrupts into the interrupt vector table as i couldn't get manual addressing of the interrupt vector table to work right, i also had to include stdlib.h to get a definition for null as this was written for bc++ 3.1, and i also used a university-provided scheduling library, everything else was implemented from scratch) that can support arbitrary thread counts without choking on issues like deadlocks.most other large projects i did were various flavours of webshit, though some of them had a bunch of mainstream features, including things like integrating recaptcha and paypal, or writing a forum with recursive reply trees where upvotes/downvotes update in real time for every viewer, or a real-time chat.currently i'm writing a compiler for a heavily simplified version of java that's not compatible with mainstream java but can be used for simple programs.are any of those projects something that could be enough to make a prospective employer overlook my trashfire tier gpa, or am i essentially unemployable as a software engineer if my gpa is shit?pic unrelated.
i did a degree beforehand and got credited for all the programming beforehand
i did and it will definitely do that well enough
i did because i have a cheap aliexpress 75% that's not qmk.
i did but it's fucking gay and was easier to just use gsuite for my domain.
i did calculations and it should be able to do 960*540 30hz with no compression.
i did exactly this
i did have to install nonfree repos to get my nvidia card working properly, but i suppose that's my fault for using jewvidia
i did install it for fun on my desktop and it runs remarkably well (but then again, i just use vi and a browser)
i did it and replaced their directory with a single copy of zsnes and one rom of tales of phantasiat
i did just that i now i have something thatk works(?) but i don't know what i have.
i did look into getting a large aio like an alphacool 420 and a gpu aio to connect to it, though i'd rather build the loop myself so i have more control over the individual parts (i don't like the pump or fans)
i did not take any privacy or anonymity precautions at that time because i didn't think it is wrong or something like that.is there anything i can do to disassociate/clearn myself and my devices from the past online activities and thus make them not be connected to me or anything like that?
i did once pulled the cooler out with the cpu, but luckily didn't have any bent pins.
i did said you dont need, i said if that i can do these things
i did t know about the custom domain but
i did that and i ran sensors and it worked well enough
i did that with a bunch of stuff that doesn't even run on my servers like phpmyadmin, wordpress, siteadmin, etc
i did this and so long your residential line is up you're good to go.
i did this for all companies and i got a call back and an offer
i did this on my pc when i had windows by using hxd and changing some values but i have got linux mint now and the unity version is updated as well
i did until i was furloughed because of rona
i did work on a dos machine until about five years ago
i did, it's>botnet vs other botnet
i didn't do much, and was the worse student in my apcs class
i didn't even know you could have fat palms.
i didn't expect everyone to like 90's look.
i didn't fall for the stem meme so i don't have a hard time finding a job because i don't have to compete with billion chink and pajeet h1bs.
i didn't find a job for years after my msc, but my career started with someone i know
i didn't finish my degree, only attended university for one year and focused on workingworked like a civil engineer for 13 years straight since i was 18/19, now that i'm 32, i can't find a job..
i didn't have a desktop until i built one in 2014 as a college graduation present to myself 2014 - 2016 in the bedroom of my one bedroom apartment2016-2018 in the bedroom of my townhouses shared with some friends2018-today in the den of another apartment with my gfstarting in september in a spare bedroom of the house we just bought
i didn't it was a shitty old pc that i had gotten a shit cheap 120$ 1050ti back in 2017 built a new pc in feb 2020 with a 2060 super but i returned every gpu i got because i kept hearing every month oh shit new gpu out soon its fccking august now just fuck my shit up senpai
i didn't know toasters could shitpost
i didn't know you could drive fvwm with the keyboard like that.
i didn't like him after that one episode where he got super mad about the others making rape jokes
i didn't need more for a gtx970 and i don't even play gaymes that often.
i didn't post it here silly
i didn't realize pentester was such an entry level role
i didn't say it was a natural number
i didn't say it was like void that actually attempts to replicate parts of bsd systems
i didn't say to use systemd
i didn't think about repasting, i'll get some paste!
i didn't think you'd already have it
i didn't understand much so i just said yes.>search the internet how to fix it yourself
i didn't want to reveal my power level in front of him so i said nothing
i didnt make the thread, i only corrected the op
i didnt say share it then, post link to proof
i dig it.
i disabled my windows ssd, installed a second ssd, installed ubuntu, enabled grub, enable my windows ssd
i disagree with linux being unstable, since the majority of the internet runs on linux servers and almost every service that boasts a 99% uptime is run on linux
i discovered i can double click the title bar but it wasn't very discoverable
i ditched pihole for dnscrypt-proxy and dnsmasq
i do
i do a bit of casual gaming and the only thing i miss from windows is msi afterburner
i do a majority of my gaming on pc
i do a monthly differential of my file shares on the synology box to tape
i do all my reading on an ipad pro now and it feels much better.
i do and i use unbound, no forward zones configured, just root hints
i do approve the tip about using computers without an internet connection.a lot of the distractions that people commonly face aren't so much because of computers per se, but from the internet
i do auditing in healthcare, but it seems like there is ever the push for having more of a cyber background
i do flutter we can corner the market
i do game but i've got two monitors, one of them exclusively for productivity (dell u2415)had it for like 5 years now, 16:10 is best girl
i do hate everything about the taskbar and notification area, it's massively over-designed
i do have a custom pc running windows, so don’t consider calling me a fanboy.
i do have a power cord for it (borrowed it from my instantpot)
i do have a trackball, that's why i said mouse are more precise.
i do have the gcam port, but it's not perfect
i do if i spend more than a few minutes in our server room, it's not just the db volume but the frequency of the fans will ruin your hearing.
i do not believe that people are in danger
i do not get the cooler design.a single fan with a diameter smaller than the card itself is problematic already
i do not hate c, but to recommend c, a language that is essentially dedicated to systems programming, as a language to learn as someone who knows absolutely nothing about coding is just plain stupidif you just want to learn programming for making high-level programs, most of the features that c offers that other languages like python barely offer have little to no value for you
i do not know how to use javaexperiment i dont know if this thread will even work but hopefully /g/ knows what there doing
i do not know of a single mouse not made in prc so yes they are all that bad
i do not own a phone or use email.
i do not think it is related to the gpu overheating, as before and after the gpu seems to be running in a normal temperature range
i do occasionally play shadow of war and gta v though but whenever i start a game i fee like i'm wasting time :(
i do parser stuff sometimes and i'm working on an entry for the replit language jam.
i do play console games occasionally, and the first thing i notice every time is how shitty the frame rate looks
i do the reverse proxy and le certs for https
i do think i'm going to pursue s-video instead of composite and using a professional / broadcast s-vhs vcr, just to increase the chances of grabbing everything there is to see.
i do think that, can you prove me wrong?
i do try other distros for servers but that's not hopping.
i do use an iphone but im having serious doubts i’ll keep using iphones these days
i do use it.started using it personally because i'm a fan of pike and thompson (i use plan9 personally).convinced the small startup i work at to slowly but surely migrate our services to go (were small flask apps).fun times.{ react app } ||{ django app } == { go service }
i do well with fast beats and lofi makes me want to fall asleep.
i do yoga, i’ve done plenty of lsd, i had a slight hippie phase, still am in some respects, and i recognize the value of having extremely strong ideals to push a philosophy that you know will otherwise never succeed.but at the same time we all have to be realistic at some point, because we all have to live together, but we will probably never die together
i do, however, use a lot of hotkeys because i hate using a mouse
i do, you do, and even if you trust others to do everything right in a full spirit of agreement with your ideology - they will sin too
i do.
i don'eet know what that is itss nota retro vintage gaming nostalgic vintage retro gaming!
i don't
i don't because i'm not a consoomer that buys a new phone each year.i only have my mi a2 charger that came with some weird type of plug and an adapter and the switch charger that has the cable soldered.
i don't blame em honestly
i don't buy books twice, i've got them in paperback but i refuse to pay for them again, so i got them from libgen instead
i don't care
i don't care about gab, but this clearly shows mastodon can and will censor you for wrong think.
i don't care about how many vulnerabilities that are patched before they are even announced my os has
i don't care about the whole helping you sleep thing anyway
i don't care about unix.on the side, i don't see what systemd has to do with windows.
i don't care about what insider information i should've had, if the default package manager completely breaks by regular usage, the distro is shit.
i don't care for the rewards gimmick
i don't care i just wanna coom.
i don't care if amd will be anti consumerist or have a monopoly, i just want intel to suffer.
i don't care if it ends up working like windows
i don't care if its an invidious link or some other shady website
i don't care if they promise constant updates or services
i don't care what you did in college.i don't care how you understand rendering.what is technically, technically achievable in a laboratory setting =/= what you can give the majority peoplethese decisions are made for a reason.and i explained the reasons.>kidok dude.
i don't care.i have better use for my time than writing nested loops with gazillion counters of columns and whitespaces.
i don't code, though
i don't doubt for a second that the same could happen in the us if companies thought they could get away with it.basically, if implants end up like how phones and vr headsets are now, which i think they at least mostly would, then fuck no
i don't even care about retro games
i don't even have a premium
i don't even have cds to test it now but when i do i'll give it another shot.

i don't even own either of those.
i don't even use arch, i run a personal mirror for a different distro because i have multiple machines in the same local network that can pull packages from it and my external download speed sucks
i don't even use linux you fucking faggot, only incels like the bugman in op and yourself waste time arguing about operating systems.>(remember that chinkcel was making 6 figures while you were collecting 500 a month in autismbux at 23)i'm an industrial electrician who works half the year on oil rigs, i make well over $200k most years
i don't even use quotes if there aren't too many special chars because you can just escape the space and for some reason '\' is easier to hit than '-'
i don't even use windows and i know this
i don't even want the reward that much, i just want to have some fun discovering issues and reporting them.don't know where a good place to start would be where there are actually any issues left.
i don't feel anything but hopefully they deliver this time
i don't feel it's coloring things in right way, the brush leaves random marks7.seriously, this interface is fucking trashoh my gosh how i fucking hate this thing...are open source developers a brainlets?
i don't feel like that's much to agonize over
i don't get it why don't yall just create your own gpu with your custom needs?
i don't get it, why do some languages have def and similar when they already have lambda?what's the purpose
i don't get it.
i don't get itdo engineers pass data around these layers manually, or does the chip handle all this with some magic shit?
i don't get people who want a working pc on their phone
i don't give a fuck about stupid tiktok, but the way people defend the decision is mind boggling.yep, nsa, prism doesn't exist etc etc etc
i don't give a fuck, if i can buy that service here in brazil, i'm 100% ok with those not so impressing speeds.fuck clarofuck vivofuck gvtfuck copel

i don't have the freedom to choose softwarenot true, you can install android or even linux onto your hardware if you wish: https://youtu.be/sxeqvza40-0>unlike consoles, phones are multipurpose

i don't jack off to gui or waste time on scripts.
i don't keep it for disposable shit like toasters but do for anything worth fixing.
i don't know
i don't know about 1000000x better, but it's certainly a noticeable difference.
i don't know about amd but nvidia specifically places the pci-e power connectors where they are so that they'll poke out of the top of the card
i don't know animals, but some kind of predator that lures prey by mimicking social signals.
i don't know any basic c resources, sorry
i don't know but i think i already crossed it so might as well go all in
i don't know either)my belief is that its food, primarily the endocrine disrupting pesticides, but also the mutant nature of wheat, corn and other (former) staple foods which both ruin the gut biome and throw the hormonal system out of whack
i don't know enough about power generation to know if doing it pneumatically makes sense in this application.a sealed vessel will hold pressure as long as the pressure and conditions are within tolerance
i don't know exactly, but i think this is not pyramid scheme or any kind of scam
i don't know guys i am thinking about cs but i am not sure, i want to make something big, ee is my second choice, i am not 100$ sure on what to do.
i don't know how i can make the vm give me files back to the folder
i don't know how much you can get for that man
i don't know how that works but many have told me having a portfolio (which i will have as soon as i finish my app and make the aforementioned 'commercial projects' look way nicer) is a very good thing to have if you have an unrelated non-it degree.what should i do?
i don't know how to search for a new mouse, it's been over ten years
i don't know how to thank you so here's a cat picture that is rather on with the theme of this board.ciao!
i don't know how you even try to reason with these morons, i couldn't do it
i don't know if that counts as centrist though.
i don't know if they made the generic ones shorter specifically to accommodate the newer keyboards or just to save $0.0001, but it's certainly an improvement when using them on newer models.the oem pack i got also contains a classic dome one, which is really not bad, but i still prefer soft rim.
i don't know if this is the right thread to ask in, but here we go, after a windows 10 update, my laptop started booting up really slowly (from mere seconds to 3 minutes) and my framerate got worse in all games i played (tf2, cs:go)
i don't know if you're agreeing with or disagreeing with the post you're quoting, but you have trips so i guess that means you're right either way.
i don't know if you're trolling or you just haven't done a comparison test, but the difference in sound quality from a cell phone microphone vs a separate condenser mic is night and day
i don't know programming so i assume i'll have to learn a language
i don't know shit about it but just wondering..
i don't know shit about software architecture/design patterns.
i don't know shit except that i'm good with tech.is the way to start just to first learn general programming and then try to learn an engine like unreal?
i don't know that either.
i don't know the details anymore, but i think the result gets cast to the baseclass, therefore losing the useful things of the derived class.no matter what workarounds exist, i think your implementation of oop is fundamentally broken if you cannot have such an operator simply work.this also holds for the error messages in templates
i don't know the exact screen model but xps screens on ebay look around $300-$500
i don't know the extent of what it covers but it is very well written and has great exercises.should be everything you need.i majored in math and knew most of the stuff already, else i would have read it eagerly.

i don't run an os therefore my solution is more minimal.
i don't see a reason why it should exist, as rhel is fine, but i don't care.
i don't see anyone shitting themselves about this news though, considering it was discussed close to a month ago
i don't see anything being done in that screenshot
i don't see point in using framework (yet).
i don't see that happening anytime soon.

i don't think it's because they are worse at their job
i don't think it's worse, every user automatically contributes to the network
i don't think most jobs need that.
i don't think so
i don't think so, as i constantly hear about laptop lights getting hacked, and such a feature should be unhackable unless somebody figures out some crazy way to make it overcharge the bulb and burn it out or something.
i don't think so.
i don't think that they're going to sell a computer that outperforms a high end i7 for 599$/799€, i think it's more probable that it will go for 1000$/1500€.
i don't think the 3d technology has ever been better than this.
i don't think the way you are trivializing the ability to break the xen hypervisor is particularly constructive, in any case it's just guessing and i think more people are interested in general security aspects of it from the perspective of protection from criminals and such.

i don’t do cuda
i don’t know where you live or anything
i don’t miss ray tracing
i don’t really care about performance, i just really like coding
i don’t see anything specific about os x that would draw me to it.
i don’t think anybody wanted him to leave, and the only thing i did was limit his access when i noticed him going off the rails (i figured he was very likely to snap and abuse his power to block people other than counterpillow, who had absolutely deserved it at the time), a decision which was then reverted just before he *actually* started blocking people over nothing
i don’t use social media so i don’t care.
i doubt anyone here has feelings for drivers unless they wrote them themselves.
i doubt anyone is that miserable that they would actually contact someones employer.
i doubt he can even read english.
i doubt the decentralized nature of the community would make it possible, maybe if enough package maintainers and application developers just refused to support them ever again
i doubt this will go beyond 3 bucks +shipping and will be perfect for my project!
i download fucking linux (fedora) and decide to use gnu octave
i downloaded ff for android to see what you retards are whining about and this probably has been the best ui i've come across in a phone browser, plus it had the add-ons i regularly use
i dropped out to work because college is a scam.

i dunno why people shit on asus in recent years

i even went out of my way to download edge for my windows 10 ltsc, it's a pretty good browser
i eventually had the fbi sicked upon me for being on the wrong side of work politics and because they couldn't find a good reason to get rid of me, considering they were still using my work and continue to do so to this day
i expect it to suffer massively in the gpu front though since i'm sure nvidia will do something to fuck it over, and amd has no incentive to back a competing technology either.
i expect my new rig to last me the better part of the decade so i've already got two 16gb sticks at the modest speed of 3600mhz with room to upgrade for two more and if somehow i end up doing enough editing and multimedia type stuff that even 64gb ends up not being enough my board is rated for up to 128gb of ram at 4666mhz in xmp
i expected /g/ to have a more levelheaded/pragmatic take on the leak, yet we still observe the very same responses as on /v/
i expected there to be phrases and keywords that, if used in the op, would cause a thread to auto-sage
i expected to be disbelieved, but nothing could have prepared me for that
i fap to tiktok once a day wtf
i fed a markov bot posts from 2 days and this is how he responded to op's title:>on macos, where safari is unusable by non-normies due ironically enough the closed source nature of ms-dos and later windows enforcing a set of the other languages feels like c++ users who were unhappy about a new competitor that you can use deterministic algorithms will allow your custom container to interoperate with the rest yourself.
i feel less bad about laughing when criminals and terrorists attack disarmed populations.

i feel like i'm missing something here, like some sort of compromise between being a luddite and using the internet.
i feel like i'm screaming in the dark here.you probably already know who i am, but i'm not gonna post my desktop
i feel like linq is 90% of the time just used as an extension library instead of an actual language extension.c# is absolutely one of the best general purpose languages out there.
i feel like my one-two line comments were much more concise, and not to go full-code should document itself, but i think naming functions and variables clearly, coupled with minimal but informative comments is more than enough, no?thanks for reading my xanga.
i feel like people busy enough to make org useful probably don't use it
i feel like these events should have a chill/party element to them.

i feel the same way and i own an 8700kcope and seethe
i feel you
i feel yougive me a 4 phone with a quality display and modern hardware and i'd be happy
i fell for the horizontal mb memecase
i fell for the pale moon meme so give me some addons to install?
i fell for the trade school meme>spend over $10k on a technical school to learn about hvac>director says i'll make that money make instantly >get promised a job immediately after graduating>boomer instructor literally cannot stop talking about his personal life and stories than teach the class>get epa universal certificate to start working>don't get a job and have to search on my own>no one calls back>eventually get one place call me back and they wanna charge me the same of an amazon wagie while having to buy all my tools and safety equipment>workplace is dangerous and back breaking>every co-worker is literally a degenerate druggie boomer who scream at me because i'm the new guy>eventually quit after refusing to add insulation at this high rise project

i found one of these today, but without the peripherals, just the monitor.does it have any usefulness?
i found the fucking slut

i fucked up heavily by using the pure copper ihs that came with the delidding kit and losing the intel ihs (that's basically pure copper anyway) because the tin or whatever coating prevented the weirdness i'm experiencing now where the lm is drying out and it seems like pieces of metal are stuck on the surface of the cooler

i mean it may as well not be since there are collectively 6 people in the world now who know this very important fact
i mean it's a step up from normal ios but even if it was better than android, the fact that you need to use an iphone instantly negates any pros.
i mean microsoft for example collects data anyways afaik and things like cpu microcode exist too
i mean not just looks, but ease of usage.
i mean revert back to windows 7 update model
i mean shit like this:https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphone-find-x2-pro/don't know what the name for this kind of style is, but it feels so fucking repulsive to scroll through, the beginning is fine but then suddenly all those transitions happen.

i mean, i am buying a 3090 d-1 but that is mainly due to the fact that i need it for ml workloads and i can't afford to homegame an a100
i mean, i have no issues finding cheap or decent hosting, problem is:if i choose variant with self-hosting + no encryption then there is a risk that hoster might get pozzed later and start to work with feds/sell meta-data for advertisers or my platform can get hacked because i cannot spent 20 years in security field first, i just need a goddamn sync solution.this brings me back to encryption on client side, but then if i already encrypt my files before putting them into cloud then why should i waste my funds on hoster?

i might try updating firmware or formatting fat32 but just wondering if anyone has experience with this.
i miss .net so muchi've been trying to solve a problem the entire fucking day on rust but the arbitrary rules bring everything to a halt,it's a herculean task to use closures with traits because there's a ton of particularity about specialization, lifetimes, not to mention hiding everything inside boxes because boxes magically make everything safe.i miss just coding algorithms

i never felt so useless, and i don't know how to stop this cycle.
i never followed any recruitment leads in college
i never got around to order one and now i regret it a lot

i never seen a mac ad.>i don't work with any apple-specific software then i don't see much of a point, specially if you're a freetard and want to have muh control over your computer.the biggest pro for macs (outside of trackpads and battery life) is having pro software on an os that doesn't suck.aside that, buying macs now when arm refresh is coming in a few months is fucking stupid.
i never seen a mac ad.you're looking at one.
i never thought that.
i never understood the range top/oven combo, why not just use a full range?
i never understood why the iphone was a big deal cause i had one of those back in 2000.>>77072327this is probably just a modern pc in a c64 shell, since the c64 can't drive 2 monitors, nor can you connect an intellimouse to it (not without a ps/2 dongle and even then i don't know if the pinout is compatible both in hardware and in software).
i never understood why the iphone was a big deal cause i had one of those back in 2000.windowsce was even more advanced, but had its downsides too.watching normies jizz over the iphone was frustrating, because apple took credit for inventing all this shit that i'd been using for years.
i never used one before and i don't really need one so much nor can afford a good paywall one.pic unreleated
i normally have no use for a webcam, but with classes being online this fall, it looks like i have no choice but to get one, and i'm a poorfag so i'm looking to spend as little as possible.cheapest one seems to be pic related

i notice the same too and i believe its the vantage software doing dodgy shit while it believes im not aware.
i noticed ddg search results taking a heavy quality dip a few weeks back.switched to qwant after that.did they change the backend, or something like that?

i quite my job right before covid and have been unemployed and studying programming since (building flask apps, learned c, java, ajax, jquery, learning react now) and keep getting the feeling like i havent even scratched the surface of what every web dev know (native stuff, golang, sass, all the js library rigamaroll, etc.) what were your paths to gaining the knowledge you have now?

i recommend haskell from first principles.
i recommend htdp as it has more exercises than sicp, and through the well structured 500+ coding exercises ranging from making games to coding algorithms and refactoring code, it actually teaches you how to think like a software engineer
i recommend reading books.old books.brew a cup of coffee and sit outside with a book.
i recovered some photos, records, documents, and governments-related records.
i refuse to use those dogshit machines
i refuse to watch even one more video of someone who makes a living as a tech consoomer who makes videos of setups and edc and pretends he does anything useful with his thousand dollar gear.
i regret buying a pc unironically
i regret it, it's too mushy and loud, should've gone for a tougher brown.

i regularly watch tech linked news but that's it >>77275887this.t

i remember accidentally deleting some other game i liked and playing this for the first time
i remember back then i used to try and load in the youtube site on my psp 2k but couldn't cause of my shitty browser, haha
i remember half the classes in my first year for group work [which involved programming] almost all teammates dropped out and i was either alone or with a random who only showed up to meetings
i remember her working in this computer when i was young -she was a journalist- so i'm planning restoring it and keeping it
i remember how this retard told that reddit is for discussion of red problems no matter if staff ever sees this shit
i remember i used to get these with that error a lot, and it turned it was a music prod controller i was using that needed an ac adapter because if it just pulled from the machine it would cause the bsod when it starts going crazy with the lights to bpms of songs.
i remember my mom being annoyed it booted automatically into linux so i changed the bootloader to boot into windows for her and the rest of the family.used ubuntu and derivatives mostly, but hopped around to various distros and pretty much tried them all.now?

i remember that /b/ board
i remember that gamepad
i remember that thread
i remember those times
i remember when i first start learning to program, they were really fucky and i couldn't understand them until i'd used them in anger multiple times.perhaps they should just be called inline functions instead
i remember when i had that wallpaper in high school.
i remember when the ipad came out and shortly after the competitors like the blackberry playbook and some acer thing were announced and /g/, as always, thought it would be the end of apple and their shitty obscure plastic chinky tablets were better in some wayif any of you reading this were part of the camp that was posting this, i think we can both agree that we're all laughing at you now in retrospect
i remember when they tried to make a.c.a.b
i remember you
i removed all the distro kernels, grub and quite a lot of stuff in general
i renamed some apps on my desktop and now they don't have a thumbnail.how 2 fix?also, is there a way to change thumbnails to your own pictures?
i reported it only several days ago from kurobahttps://github.com/adamantcheese/kuroba/issues/1013i suppose it's too challenging
i respawned and went to wear i had been killed and saw that they were burying my corpse, then they all turned to face me and shouted so long sucker.then my screen went blank , my computer set on fire and both my arms fell off and my house collapsed
i rest my case
i returned the newly released g604 because it got the double click faulty switch issue in less than 1 week of usebought a g600 from 2014 instead and it's perfect

i run pkg upgrade in termux sometimes.
i run void linux xfce on it

i said functional not retarded.
i said it's huge, not that it's expensiveyou will have to take literally 15-25% off the battery capacity to fit in the coil to do wireless chargingseriously, open a phone with wireless charging and the first giant pad thing you will see is the coil
i saw a computer magazine with a knoppix disc
i saw a guy on youtube running ubuntu in a virtual machine and was like wooow i gotta do thatyeah and basically i spent a lot of days of my childhood emulating shit in virtual machines, for..
i saw a youtube video about some ea guy making his own game engine in youtube.he talks about file systems, virtual memory, a debug and profile systems, diferent rendering architectures and libraries for his engine.i was like, sure, that's nice.but is that really necesary when i just want to make a 2d game with a 3d background?like i just need some basic ecs system, with some character entity, some fsm logic, some character team manager, a 2d renderer, some 3d renderer for the background, a basic camera system, a soundengine for the sound and music, some spark systems, and some basic gui shit with some menues systems for the non gameplay menues, and some basic debug text on console or just an overlay gui (just text).am i doing something wrong, or is just all the nice enterprise quality tools necesary?
i saw in anime this tv tower collapsed
i saw it has an integrated torrent client but i'm not sure how good that is.
i saw sennheiser had this new version of the sennheiser hd 280 pro out (pic related)
i saw some streamer get a windows 10 let's knock one out you need to update message several times in a row
i saw the threads about debian users getting their pc bricked after an update and i was wondering as a new ubuntu user who switched from win10 (complete noob) if i might fuck things up, should i switch distro again?
i saw this post on /b/ a few nights ago and it really hit home, so i thought i'd share.you guys do have portfolios, right?
i saw this video: building an insane edc roadside emergency kit - episode 1 - main tool bag: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29bwl86eamylooked and i don't see one
i say geology because i believe biology is subgeology.
i say there's nothing wrong with old hardware, and you can still do pretty much anything on it with the correct optimizations made.
i say wait till oled displays are cheap and get yourself a good 4k monitor on sale, then consider upgrading.
i second >>77489944; comfy open-source, de-googled chromium fork with built-in ad-blocking and other nice security featuresonly downside so far is that the f-droid repo seems to be down due to an expired cert, so i had to get an apk from github
i see 1 game running at a time and a few seconds loading time
i see a lot of conflicting info out there.
i see a lot of great devs from germany all the time.
i see amd has switched up their anti-nvidia strategy by fear mongering now.
i see anki is apparently not good past 3 months, which is ok
i see good octanes pop up for way less than that, i'd rather have one of those if i went for another sgi.
i see none.
i see that such a machine is unusable (damn shame) in 2020 but there is absolutely no excuse for modern software to fuck up a machine with 4gb of ram
i see the price fixing
i see this all the time with management this should take 2 days at most
i see this has never been refuted by /g/is rust really that good?
i see two shortcomings:1) you don't know how to cook worth a shit2) you don't know how to program worth a shit
i see what you did there.
i see, thanks.
i see.i requested to add keys to this:dsa individual keys (sublimated)https://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-individual-keys-sublimated/
i seem to get the blackscreen issue only when running a mild undervolt, underclocking might work.
i self host, apache http w/ certbot, and ircd-hybrid
i seriously don't know how someone can be ok with just not getting headphones or using decent speakers
i seriously dont know why people even bother with the giant companies that do routine layoffs of 10k people
i set my webserver to return that string both in plain utf8 and in html encoded characters on some specific url paths so chinks stop trying to hack my nonexistent phpmyadmin
i set streamlink up on kodi in the chinkshit amlogic box in the living room
i set this in customize and copied it form init.el to my config.org file and it just werks
i should at least get x4 at pcie 3.0 imo
i should complain to my landlord
i should have also specified that they need to be like 40-48v, so none of those stupid 12-24v ones
i should have assumed this
i should have taken an image of this but i essentially have to reapply the lm every few months
i should mention this is coming from someone who owns 3 mech keyboards>60% with lubed / filmed gateron black inks>75% with lubed / filmed t1s>96% with kailh box jades
i should not have to reconnect each appliance in a room until i find the one that tripped the breaker
i shouldn't have to come up with examples of why this is useful, searching the text of tabs is a feature that should exist by defaultthis.i have tons of tabs open, not only because i don't finish everything in one day, but because i work on multiple projects at once
i shouldnt have to boost 30 decibels to hear it.
i side with the user
i simply want different ips in every terminal nothing more.>nice scraper.i think you don't get how it works so let me give you a example of what it actually is
i simultaneously shill for/against brave because i like dramaeich is still a faggot though
i sit on my bed with my back to the wall and my laptop on my, well, lap
i sjust saw lone lgr video i love retro windows omg michael mjd windows xppppppp whistlerrrr nostalgia retro gaming retro nostalgia!!!
i slapped a $60 scythe fuma on the 3900x and, while it's louder than my undervolted 4790 was (which wouldn't go above idle fan speed on its 212 evo), it's only a pretty quiet whoosh even with the sides of my case off
i sold my 2012 macbook air in 2018 for $875 and used that to buy a new macbook for only a few hundred bucks, then i plugged in my time machine drive and within an hour all of my programs, settings and data were on my new mac and it basically felt like having the same machine that just magically got better specs overnight.
i sometimes get an urge to upgrade it to something new but i just don't think there's a point, i really don't think i could hear a difference
i sometimes turn my ds4 into a ghetto wireless mouse so i can control mpv.net on my bed.switch pro controller is fucking nice if you have one of those; fairly certain somebody released an xinput driver for it recently
i sometimes wonder if i should move where my 15 years of programming experience will earn me 6 figures but would it be worth it
i somewhere along the way i managed to crack my lcd
i spend about €1500 of that
i spent 1.2k ausbucks when the s8 first came out
i spent most of high school learning more and now i make $95k/yr no college degree working for an msp
i spent the better part of yesterday staring at computer screens.my eyes are straining, even a day later.how does one circumvent this?
i spent the next several months at lower productivity and when the new architecture came out they were not as cost effective over time as the radeon viis
i spent thirty minutes installing docker, mongodb, nodejs and vscode
i spread my wealth over almost all of them.cashbankcryptoreal investmentswhy would i want to have a single point of failure
i stand with them
i start uploading at random intervals of whatever the hell i wanted
i started at 12 but obviously anything you do at that age is pretty much shit so 17 is completely fine
i started getting serious about data archiving since circa 2002 perhaps
i started learning nodejs in 2017 because it seemed like alot of hype and respect was around it
i started learning python almost a year ago and made very little progress thanks to work getting in the way
i started programming for first time so obvs started with c++ and python for first couple of months.yesterday i was bored and decided to see what the fuss is about html and css.hmmm is it supposed to be this easy?
i started reading it but it looks like it would take a full year and i didn't have that time.
i started the odin project
i started using element (formerly riot) and it seems alright, but still kinda janky at times
i started using the gnu operating system because it's free software, not because it's similar to unix
i stated that it looks better that os11 (big sur)
i still can't believe they didn't adopt officially a 64bit support
i still don't know what phone to get for the same price, i don't know if the s20+ is even a good phone overall
i still don't understand why amd drivers on windows should be awful when mesa can make good linux drivers.i mean, mesa is open source, just read their code.
i still get security patches on s8+
i still have a long way to go
i still have one from forever ago
i still have the classic edge enabled, it's the best pdf reader on windows
i still have to decide...p.s
i still intend to get through it and do all the exercises
i still miss the old days of drunkencoders, eurasia.nu and tehskeen (rip) and now that maxconsole is gone - well fuck them anyway - ive got nothing left of my golden years
i still need to seed more torrents for systemd-free distros
i still prefer 1080p for general gaming to this day since you dont require a ton of graphics horsepower to run modern games and it still looks fine even when i plug the pc into the c9
i still think space colonization is a bad meme.
i still think the price is a bit too high
i still use 60hz and don't care about even 75hz let alone 144+
i still use a 2 tb barracuda from 2013
i still use nano because it just werks and i can't be bothered to learn vim if i don't even program

i still use upp mirc
i still want to know why this fellow has flipped and stretched the graph though
i still want your funds gentile!
i stopped using linux some time in 2008
i store all my passwords and favorites in my head.
i strongly dislike rolling releases.does debian testing still break every time they make a stable release?
i strongly encourage you to go fuck yourself
i strongly encourage you to research the times you are in
i stuck with this for a long time.
i suck cocks.
i suck cocks.yes you do.>>78530826i'll try this out.
i suggest indeed
i suggest you all stop your chinese consuming before it happens to you too
i suggest you sell that gamer piece of shit and get a real split keyboard.
i suggest you stop using trash like spotify and instead start downloading the music you like, then play them locally
i suppose part of the distinction is between advertising as a professional thing involving paid television spots or armies of posting bots versus advertising as, well, an individual shitposting but also trying to engage in conversation like this.>>77359255>comfyvery based
i suppose the idea is>just be a good parentbut that's hard.
i suppose you could filter it with ublock's element picker thing.
i swear every houses' router was this.
i swear every single one of my retarded friends that have an iphone have this shit enabled
i swear that made it worse tho
i swear the niggers that buy apple-shit can't even read using it anyways.
i swear this is some reverse shill shit
i swear to fucking god
i swear to god i spend more time fighting jest than i do writing logic at my place of work because the previous engineers have coverage thresholds set to 100.javascript is a dynamic language for the browser
i swear to god if (((they))) manage to make some sort of serializer or a decent way to work with static typing in the js runtime i will bow down to master gates and let him fuck my ass raw
i swear to god that shit is literally a keylogger
i switched from 14 years of pc use to mac os x, and i have to say that while it did take a while to get used to-- the one button mouse is much more intuitive than a 2-button mouse.you can do everything on os x just using the mouse and clicking to get it, everything in a contextual menu can be found either in a button or the apple menu.also another beauty in os x is that everything can be controlled through the keyboard which some people find very intuitive.if you really 'need' to invoke a contextual menu you just hold down control and click-- it really isn't that hard, and it probably isnt necessary anyway.
i switched from 23 1080p to 27 1440p and i also kept the old one as a secondary monitor
i switched from i3 to dwm after 2 years.i kept accidentally quitting x bc the keybind for closing a window in i3 was identical to quitting x in dwm (super+shift+q, alt+shift+q)
i switched from kubuntu to opensuse and i love it>>77061947kde is retardedly bloated
i switched off as many app permissions as i could and nothing happened except for a constant notification about google services bitching that they need their permissions back
i switched to linux in 2015 and irfanview is the main windows application i still miss.
i take about 2 minutes to choose what bag of chips to get from the store based on chips i've had in the past weeks and what soda i buy (it's at most once a week on weekends - don't worry about my health)
i take offense to that i am not a poc.
i take public transport to work so nc is a must
i teach and make my interns use git through the command line while i use a gui myself
i tell them it's better because of the out of the box user friendliness, no shady shit from a to be microsoft owned company and because it's not gnome
i tested with a couple of inputs, and it seemed to work just fine.#include <stdbool.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>bool has_digit(int num, int digit) { for (; num != 0; num /= 10) { int num_digit = (num % 10); if (num_digit == digit) { return true; } } return false;}int main() { int m,n,min=0x7fffffff; bool has_min = false; scanf(%d %d, &m, &n); if (n == 0) { printf(not inputting any numbers
i thank the beta-testing virgins.
i then started doing more interesting stuff and learning c for making video games
i think (???)>try to google how to do it>get shit loads of torify is dangerous because you can configure it wrong bla bla bla.>the application can dns leak bla bla bla>seriously don't give a shit.>its only legal pictures from a legal service that i want to scrape no logins and no nothing.these tor-pedos and tor-terrorists (and tor-usa agents spying on enemy governments, we know why you made tor glowies) should be glad i'm pushing my scraping over tor so their illegal shit gets obfuscated with my trafic.all i wanted is a free (as in no money) ip for every terminal window that runs the scraper.is this to hard to get?
i think a lot of it is them blowing smoke up everyone's asses such as the fbi's endeavors to fight encryption in pathetic think of the children fashion
i think a lot of us are constantly debloating our stuff
i think amd gpus prefer to run with amd cpus, but i don't know if that's accurate either (traditional testing has showed nvidia being a stuttery mess with uneven frametimes, again, i haven't seen a test on the 2000-series so can't say if that holds true)
i think america is going to collapse and/or be taken over by another country in the next 50 years
i think bitwarden or keepass
i think foss software will eventually react - i think free software is ultimately in the position to deliver such software distribution technology.
i think hardware support for gc makes a lot of sense.
i think he finally realized this his 6+ deep handmade garbage project was going nowhere, as he debugged raycasting performance issues for the 40th stream in a row.
i think he may have also used some online yt to mp3 downloader to source the mp3s.
i think he means personally buying it vs asking each employer to buy it
i think he's right
i think html is the friendliest programming language there is, even more than python.
i think i am a fucking retard for choosing to learn c#, every fucking thing is so bloated about this language starting from the syntax and ide and ending with all of it frameworks
i think i could leave and make a fuckload more doing way less work.what's your life like, /g/?
i think i could open a file manager and open a file from there without any bullshit interactions, like the file being opened in the file manager itself and not allowing me to further browse files concurrently (kinda my fault for using a shit program but it's just a fact that there is a lot of trash in android ecosystem) or pdf viewer being limited to one instance so when i open another file the previous one closes (os limitation).
i think i finally got them to stop
i think i found it, looks like a shorter revision of that same pcb:http://vgamuseum.info/index.php/component/k2/item/33-amd-radeon-hd-6850
i think i fucked up.i turned off csm and now the pc won't start at all, won't even get to the bios.what do i do?
i think i may be a brainlet
i think i need to use an argument like setdisplay but i don't exactly know how to do this.i'm on a 3840x2160 display
i think i purposefully killed my ability to do anything but do menial labor and browse 4chan for my own protection
i think i still will want to eventually implement it on qmk so it's flashable to the onboard memory (i plan on using the board both at work and at home) but this'll definitely do in the interim
i think i used microsoft virtual pc back then.
i think i will be rocking this chip to the 2030s.
i think i will now.
i think i would need 2 outlets, which would take up 100% of the outlets in that area
i think i'd be happier living as a barnyard animal as long as i had a sense of community
i think i'll do this
i think i'll negotiate for a bonus for when it's done
i think i'll skip on that one, anon
i think i'm going to wait until ryzen 2 gets cheaper.
i think i'm ready to run fifa 98 now>2gb hdd?
i think i'm still going for full size keyboards, not tenkeyless or smaller.does anyone have two+ different keyboards and swap them frequently?
i think i've identified your problem
i think i've lived in 6 houses in 6 years.
i think it duplicates the kill ring entry you select though because of the kill-ring-save and kill-ring-yank
i think it has potential to be the killer video editor app for linux if succeeds.
i think it is because whoever partook in the survey is accustomed to using both like myself.
i think it looks nice.>>77062273why did you move somewhere more expensive?
i think it looks pretty good.
i think it makes sense to do a hybrid approach for songs
i think it was better when we all just used bios fucking uefi doesn't even work man
i think it was called sex kittens rpg.
i think it was quite fast anyway keep up, fastman is coming along nicely
i think it would also be fun to do a simplified version in 74 series logic.
i think it would be annoying but just asking.
i think it'd be fun to make a little home server out of it or something
i think it's a good enough tutorial
i think it's a myth that our brains become inplastic as we age.they do if you accept that you can't change.i know some dude who was an architect and in his thirties he decided to become a programmer now he's leading some project a decade later.he's kind of crazy though i wouldn't call him normal by any means.most people are probably afraid of abandoning the degrees they worked hard for.
i think it's alright
i think it's called iot these days
i think it's dutch.
i think it's intended for tech-dumb relatives to keep them out of the botnet, more so than anything.
i think it's really simpler to just come up with some interface over a database of tags.
i think it's to measure pixels, dunno, i think it could be quite handy.
i think its time he gets a kick in the ass, and if that means he ropes himself, then all the better.
i think its where some people may have a gas range and an electric stove or the reverse or have the option to do so?
i think library conflicts become a problem because of stupid people who use gdebi or sudo make install
i think my router has been hacked into
i think nnn can do this
i think one of the issues here is that if you download a 98se iso, its an earlier version
i think one of the reasons 24fps works so well though is we can see real things, but it presents them in a way we hit suspension of disbelief because it's not as smooth as real life
i think paying any more than 40 bucks on such a card is for brand recognition
i think plex and other shit does similar things but i didn't feel like figuring that out and my vnc solution is easy enough.
i think popos does gnome better than ubuntu
i think programmers are geniuses and its sad im not a genius
i think psychology is used to justify a lot of fucked up shit
i think rhel supports older kernels too
i think she would freak out and tell the family if i made a move though so i decided against it
i think since the 7950 and something like the 860 ti or some shit, i've stopped overclocking my gpu altogether, especially when the fuckers overclock themselves anyways, at the expense of my ears and peace of mind.
i think so too
i think that's a fair transaction
i think that's big enough for him
i think that's pretty neat to be honest
i think that's the problem
i think thats against the coc
i think the aosp keyboard that comes with lineage has swipe
i think the better solution here is to..
i think the file was hundreds of gb.
i think the image looks fine on 1080p on my smaller monitor, meaning that the bump up in resolution is only needed when the monitor size grows and the pixels otherwise get bigger.if you can fit it, the 27 is pretty awesome though
i think the issue was fucking wayland
i think the majority of rusties are just a bit contrarian and they like the syntax.
i think the miller column file explorer with a favorites shelf at the top (iconized instead of a list of names on the side like most explorers) like that is better than any other file manager.
i think the mobo is bad.
i think the most insidious thing is that i know how much i have to dumb everything down for any of my contributions to be sustainable
i think the only people who have issues with it are midwit neckbeards tinkering with things that ain't broke and breaking them.
i think there was a harry potter ar game like that
i think these days motherboard software (bloatware) comes with fan control, argus monitor does good as well.
i think they have bigger fish to fry than smartphones right now.
i think they honestly couldn't open source the damn thing because of legal entanglements with gaming studios
i think they just regularly change the way files can be downloaded or maybe it's some downloaders struggling with a new codec or format just use jdownloader it's always work for me when another solution stopped working
i think they make a more expensive, wireless mouse which basically has all the features of a g502 as well, but it wasn't worth the money in my eyes.
i think they might've used the same switches (loud as fuck, much harder to press than their normal switches which is a good thing to me) and certainly the same scroll assembly
i think they're neat, but i seriously doubt i would ever buy one
i think this board died december 2013.
i think this did it.>turned off sync to vblank>turned off force full composition pipeline>added nvidia-settings --load-config-only & to .xinitrc>added export vblank_mode=3 to .xinitrc>added nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to grub grub_cmdline_linux_default
i think this is specific to the case, it's an ibuypower snowblind, found it dirt cheap used so i bought it.>>77063095a case with a screen built into it
i think this is where this odd mentality comes from
i think this is why calc2 is required at most universities in the us and you can go farther depending on your focus.i did mechanical engineering and then moved over to software
i think this might actually be baseddo you notice any latency problems?
i think wahat you mean is systemd/linux
i think we need another 10 years to determine if 8 cores is a significant milestone, so far it offers only productivity advantagesand ryzen 8-core cpus have been priced terribly in comparison to the 12/6 cores, presumably because yields are shit.
i think we've met irl.
i think what i want barely qualifies as a gaming laptop but this is the only place to aski've been burned on laptops before, the last one i purchased for school was some $400 toshiba that ended up being a piece of shit
i think you can pay an extra 39 bucks to get it shipped by the end of august or something.
i think you got something wrong fellow windows user
i think you have an unrealistic view of developmentwhile what you say happens, the majority are doing fairly samey crud applications or maintenance programming
i think you have seriously misunderstood what linq actually is and how they implemented it
i think you might be using ref in a non-vue manner
i think you missed /pol/ by a couple of boards my dude
i think you misunderstood that post
i think you need to reconsider hating on apple
i think you should try manjaro
i think you uploaded the wrong pic, here is the right one anon
i think you're being a wise guy
i think your monitor is possessed!

i thought everyone but statisticians use python.
i thought floens was a girl
i thought functional programming meant avoiding state, not combining functions as terse syntactic sugar?
i thought i would hate facial unlock coming from a 3 but it honestly works incredibly well
i thought it had a lot of potential, but since the lead developer totally flaked and had some kind of life crisis, i don't trust that development will continue long-term and i've abandoned it in favor of a larger distribution that isn't going anywhere any time soon.
i thought it looked more like a blue budgie.thanks
i thought it was a bug that quote was missing
i thought it was a harder thing to get into, as in higher up the hierarchy
i thought it was because smic doesn't have access to the best lithography machines that do ultra violet light now.
i thought it was for ethots bouncing their genitals up and down, guess im a boomer
i thought it was on react

i thought jannies were volenteers and only some admins were paid.
i thought linux just werked.
i thought manjaro was the fastest minimalist distro after arch

i thought nodejs was considered good?
i thought oneplus is great with custom roms
i thought opera would be a good option since my info would be sold to vladimir who hates cia and is pretty optimized and compatible with all sort of extensions.pale moon is kinda heh because of the lack of extension support.
i thought people got sick of wasting electricity on imaginary currency.
i thought that the development stopped a long time ago

i was thinking of making one with like my server's info on it (load, top cpu using apps, etc) but i don't know that i care that much about it unless something is wrong and i'll just ssh in and fix it anywaywhat's the point of these pages anyway?

i wouldn't be surprised if the videos had different quality/rendering options too.

i'd also like to make a custom harness to interface with the docking ports rather than use the back panel for power and networking
i'd also recommend httpz to automatically redirect http sites to https when available
i'd ask about any hardware problems to look out for, but they'd either probably be too obvious to miss, or too difficult to notice on a short inspection
i'd assume about 1/4 of all posts on 4chan are made by bots
i'd assume that sending an sms or calling through wifi or data does not make an impact compared to just having the gps setting set to use wifi or data to more accurately determine location in the first place, but that's the question you're asking

i'd be like to know what were they thinking back then and when they decided to kill it.
i'd be shooting jews and degenerates left and right if i lived in that hellhole.

i'd be surprised if you can't find something similar
i'd be upgrading from a non-unlocked galaxy s7.
i'd be very pleased if it happened though.>dug up this while looking around, and to my understanding 3000cl15 ought be comparable?very similar latency (how fast it can get to new data) but less bandwidth (how much data it can transfer over time)
i'd be very thankful for your help, as i have little knowledge about cameras as a whole.
i'd contact amd see if you can get a warranty replacement
i'd expect them to spend their effort on strongarming developers into compiling native ports instead, especially so given that it's apple.
i'd get one as a toy but not as a main phone, you have to remember pine's devices are cheap for a reason, if they had actually good hardware they'd have to charge flagship prices for them, perhaps more since they are smaller batch.
i'd give it a shot if i wanted to run linux on a tablet or something but for a traditional desktop ui it's utter trash
i'd go with:aorus xtreme/crosshair viii formula128gb ram3900x1tb nvmethank you.

i'd like to want one but i don't.
i'd like to want one but i don't.rice
i'd literally rather work with your first example because it shows me what's really going on.also, all your snippets are semantically identical aside from the stack frames they create, 3 doesn't actually illustrate using them 'differently'
i'd look for deeply nested directories and such.
i'd love other choices though if you got 'em.
i'd love to see those luddites review this

i'd say access to the internet is dependant on how impressionable i perceive them to be
i'd say don't run a weird security circus that doesn't match your security analysis skills.just run a boring linux/bsd server with slight security measures..
i'd say that's bullshit because of their recent 20 series pricing bullshit like super cards in addition to ti cards and for notebook they have maxp and maxq variants
i'd say try a few different des on live-usb and see which of them you like the most, because that's mostly personal preference(although i'd advice you to avoid gnome).
i'd say zero guarantee networks (like zeronet or freenet) or federated networks (gnusocial, mastodon, peertube) have a brighter future for generic applications because of no real scalability issues
i'd sniff her packets
i'd so be ready to buy that, you people have no fucking idea
i'd sped several of my tasks up significantly
i'd understand if it were your primary editor with all its plugins and shit and idc, but for something small you might as well use one of /g/'s favorite editor: nano, vim, emacs, n++ or whatever the fuck.
i'd use iceweasel but the privacy features make it almost unusable
i'd use mu4e but external imap sync has never worked well for me.
i'd wait for next gen right now i have an r9 fury which is close to the 970
i'd walk in there was pro black shit on
i'd want to know how many hrs/week will your mentor spend with you minimum> to help scope and design development projects using technologies like ..
i'd wish i had some kind of r9 or like 270x in it or something.
i'd writelastor nil xs = case xs of [] -> nil; _ -> last xslengthoflastword = length

i'll be concise as possible, i went information systems (postgrad) to get the absolute fuck out business in general and am still refusing to touch manager jobs
i'll be going amd because i use linux and i think raytracing won't be big (almost mandatory) until the next gen gpus
i'll be impressed when they make a version with an 8 bit ide interface that will plug into my ibm ps/2 model 30.

i'll go read his blog post about rust, thanks.
i'll guess i'll just try and get in the habit of monthly backups
i'll have to look at those over time.
i'll have to see if my ds4 has the same problems.
i'll have to write up how to build it for windows at some point, but you should use msys2 and mingw-w64, add c:\msys64\mingw64\bin to your path and use pacman in the msys 2 console to install the 64 bit versions of all the required libs.
i'll help you, but only if you stop whining and crying like anyone here owes you our time.fucking /v/ crybaby.
i'll jump off a building
i'll just download the hdb encodes from ptp

i'll keep them for another day.anyway they probably made 10 millions each at least this year and the rally is just getting started in junior miners and new gen us weed penny stocks.i helped two small family offices set their infrastructure but they never paid me
i'll let you off this one time in exchange for an additional pay bump.
i'll likely be working in one of the 'big' tech cities (boston seems most likely) and germany latertldr how is information systems (in a cybersec context)
i'll live with the fact its batting below the mendoza line in attempts to power-on to actually booting consistently.shipping defective hardware isn't for tinkerers, it's poor qa

i'll remap ur caps lock key m8
i'll research the cloud engineering, thanks for guidance.
i'll run rankmirrors (from pacman-contrib) and uncomment only the lines for the 5 servers with the fastest response times.man pacman is straightforward about the -y flag
i'll say that again: nnn, a super simple file manager in the fucking terminal, can filter results and sort them.
i'll see if i can fix it up this weekend.
i'll see what i can find of references (i did a search but google panicked).>there seems to be one for /k/ stuff but not /g/.not sure what this means.>and if not books, is it only learnable through exp?crypto is rather academic and takes a lot of mathematicians

i'm >>78531483 btw, used to repair open-frame crt monitors for arcade games all the time back then.it used to be that you could get crts rebuilt, back in the day, but you'd have to have specialized tools and skills to do it, and the phosphors on the screen (and the mask, if it was a color crt) would have to be in good shape (not 'burned in') for it to be viable
i'm a bit worried about the bass though..
i'm a board member at an architecture firm.op's article is correct, they just keep raising prices while software quality and the introduction of useful features goes down the toilet.from the lack of being able to save down versions (can't save a 2020 families as 2017 for example, even if no new features are used.), they also suck on the support side.i've seen a huge number of problems that result in a stupid error message that is of no help, and the logs don't have any good information either
i'm a boomer and know nothing of music streaming
i'm a burger myself and while it's admittedly annoying as hell, it makes for great material to laugh at.

i'm also wondering if it's something to do with the particular gifs
i'm amazed retards like this even have this kind of money to spend
i'm an aspie so maybe if they can cure my tism.
i'm an audio engineer of 21 years, and logic pro x has some amazing tools that i'm having a tough time replacing in linux.if you already live without these tools, consider yourself lucky.then again, it's arguable that switching to a mac could step up your game.if you like the unix vibe, but you're willing to spend a pretty penny for it, and be able to use adobe, final cut, and logic, then switch
i'm an indie game game developer i guess you said great, so i guess no would be the answer to your question, at least in my case.well, i did write a web crawler once, but i think i was still on arch in those days.

i'm assuming that's what i should do but i wanna confirm.
i'm assuming the benefit of fdroid is knowing that an app you download there will be free of spyware

i'm at a loss what is happening here?who is gaining from this?
i'm at a point where i consider everyone is a fucking retard but me but actually i'm the one who happens to be a full time neet now

i'm enjoying the colors and unlike every other single dark theme i've tried this one is actually usable and i can read a discern things.who would've thought i didn't need to rice after all.
i'm expecting fireworks, don't disappoint me, billy g.
i'm expecting them to be more or less the same performance wise, but in case i cant get the fe, which other model would be worth it ?
i'm fairly certain they hired private investigators to stalk me after their false accusation tip didn't pan out

i'm glad i went for ownership of the site too
i'm glad people like you are out there
i'm glad standards were made at bell labs like posix (correct if wrong) that make the system so much more consistent and clear.also the animations are fucking smooth how does apple pull it off with such shit hardware and gayde devs don't?windows does have smooth animations on shit hardware feature too, so definitely fuck the trannies that work at gnome and kde.

i'm looking at getting the dm30, which has a foldable keyboard and e-ink display

i'm looking for a new one, mainly for school but with the occasional gaming like ksp etc so preferably a dedicated gpu and 16 gb ram would be nice, but also a decent battery life
i'm looking for new headphones for working/wrenching/sport in the 50-100€ range, maybe a little more if they are worth spending more and not marginal gains.currently only have the takstar pro-82, and with the wire and lose fit they are suboptimal

i'm mostly right wing these days but i still agree with that>but twitter is the town square now free speech needs to be protected there!!no, literally just go anywhere else
i'm much happier since i took the gnu plus linux pill, no system to maintain, it's a real pleasure to work on these machines, got mine in 2015 and never had a single issue.adults that aren't on the spectrum uses gnu+linux, i've met dozens of highly qualified engineers (clients i've worked for), i'm talking people working on satellites, adaptive optics, silicon wafer production, aeronautics, every single one of them are on an gnu plus linux computer, and they don't waste their precious time bitching on their os shitting itself after running apt-get upgrade.the gnu+linux pill is the ultimate pill, take it early in your career, or suffer miserably.

i'm not expecting crysis 3 or anything
i'm not familiar with github permissions but it would seem hugely retarded of one owner could just randomly remove another one.
i'm not getting rid of it i'm not made of money and i have literally no reason to upgrade now nor in the inmediate future however i specifically bought this motherboard (x570 taichi) specifically so that i could forget about it and then upgrade to the highest end gen 4 ryzen cpu in the next like 6 years at which point its cost will be flatlined and i will still be getting an incredible performance boost...in six years
i'm not going back, less than 100ppi should die.

i'm not saying i'd want to learn the entire language in a couple of days, but while i turn in my two weeks notice, study the language a bit
i'm not saying that x86 is truly open, its not, but people who think that arm is a better alternative for running the code you want are fucking retared
i'm not so sure about year, but at least it's the decade loli like to run windows in a vm cuckbox when i need it but my pc isn't nearly powerful enough to do that all the time
i'm not sure how it compares to the $85 ryzen 5 1600 af, but everything around $100 isn't worth getting getting upset about.
i'm not sure how to feel about tor
i'm not sure if images were included, but i imagine so.
i'm not sure if there are many other pmp's that have a camera.
i'm not sure it'll work well on rdna 2, but it's supposed to become a thing at least eventually

i'm not sure some of these benchmarks are legit, but i'm still waiting to see how the amd equivalent performs
i'm not sure what to code
i'm not sure why it is, maybe they spend a lot of time reading the filename or loading the image file or whatever, but the performance was orders of magnitude faster when i wrote my own version and called it as a dll even though it was just a simple set of nested for loops.
i'm not that anon but $80k a year is good fucking money in a state like florida

i'm paying way too much for an azure vm, like 90 bucks a month for something fairly basic (idgaf its on the company card), have never used digitalocean
i'm picking a mid-ranger as soon as this phone i currently own cannot be served anymore.

i'm pretty happy with how it came out
i'm pretty mad at ungoogled chromium right now, it cannot search history or give a complete list of history because of the way it stores and sorts it
i'm pretty sure adobe had a free program for that at some point
i'm pretty sure chrome's video player uses the exact same path.
i'm pretty sure it's just general webshit idk
i'm pretty sure the tim is already baked, if i were to buy a new cooler i might as well delid it and apply liquid metal.

i'm really confused.
i'm really hoping the lower midrange (enough for 1080p) drops now when rdna 2 comes out.>>77685978* rx580, hardware unboxed proved that the 580 aged well and is now better.>>77695334based and redpilled.

i'm serious, there are these little .inf files out there for monitors that just have the model name (so you don't get generic pnp monitor in device manager), a list of resolutions they support, and (often) some vague info windows can use about color gamut and gamma ramp.
i'm seriously considering a switch

i'm sick of all the retarded shilling on here
i'm sick of engadget's biting social commentary crapping up the works
i'm sick of fake advertising and low effort e-thots
i'm sitting here thinking now why would anyone go out of their way to praise the via c3 for being generally less efficient and that's all that really comes to mind it's cheap, small, but it doesn't have a lot of qol stuff
i'm skeptical about how well their trained neural network would do in a new environment rather than in the one it learned from the teacher.considering how rf signals propagate and bounce, it seems like the outcome is highly dependent on things like wall structure, other rf noise in the area, and the presence and orientation of metal or highly attenuating surfaces inside the unknown room.still though, even given these variables, you could probably very adequately estimate the location of a moving person after watching him for a little bit, even if the pose might be a bit too much.time to wrap your walls in tin foil.
i'm slowly building up from a laptop and i want a keyboard today

i'm sorry for the blogpost, but if there's any community that would enjoy a post like this, it's probably /g/.i wrote this up as a single post, but i need to split it up (field too long), and probably need to make it less verbose for anyone to be interested in reading it

i'm worried about moderna, because it starts of saying they haven't produced an approved vaccine before, but for astrazeneca, they're offering the vaccine at no profit to countries, so putting the liability on them does seem unfair.if the government takes up their vaccine and takes the profits (because it's not going to be free) and requires citizens to get vaccinated, then liability should be on the government.
i'm worried tobeho

i.e
i.e.#body { background red;h1 font-size: 12pxwould compile fine in stylus, despite missing brackets, missing colons/semicolons, etc.i wouldn't necessarily recommend it for large projects/large companies, as the style being unopinionated can be detremental at a scale, but for smaller projects it's great

if it connects to the internet, you're fucked whatever you use
if it does what you want it to it doesn't matter
if it does, would be interesting to see if you could spoof that, though i'm sure there's some kind of bounds checking on ip geolocation and reported location on the carrier-side
if it doesn't, you now have an excuse to get a new card.
if it dropped and the screen is cracked, usually for low tier laptops it's cheaper to buy a new one
if it falls through though, ill settle on an rx580
if it has an rx640 it means is the intel version

if that goes through, apple's in for some interesting times when nvidia basically will force apple to license the arm core from them, and then they can literally sit on their ass; not release a single gpu for years on end, and still rake in billions in annual revenue.

in 20 years, the story will change it to something even less believable
in 2007 it was going off the shelves for almost 4000$

in fact, on some tests of cognition, the smartest people actually showed performance reductions, a result that may address some of the concerns over “cheating”: on tasks involving working memory and impulsivity, stimulants had a leveling effect, allowing below-average performers to catch up to their peers, not dominate them.
in fact, we're at the point where 100+fps is becoming common rather than something only for the highest tier cards.

in react how can i get the setstate method to set the state of a specific array entry without messing with the other array entries?
in reality it's a pain in the ass to use, pain in the ass to install addons, and i seem to get a lot more shitty captchas when using it dunno why
in reality it's not a 1-2 waterfall thing, but rather very small incremental improvements in both areas over a longer period of time, and comes with ample relapses.
in retrospect i should've just paid twice as much for a sabrent rocket.
in rust.
in scheme this is just(define (flatten ll) (cond ((null?
in software, the end justifies the means.
in some cases, it's the blind leading the blind and not enough instructors/assistants to help all students
in some places they are the majority like in the uk, argentina, brazil or most of the us but you shouldn't condemn the whole country because of them
in some situations emacs is just slow.transition to doom was very nice, i prefer the configuration
in summary, he will act as a religious zealot would - but at least they have the excuse of acting according to god's will (right or not).yup this is definitely a freetard.
in term, i can make a selection and the menu will go away, but it will just fail to insert the selection because the buffer is read only in vterm, for some reason i can't even make a selection and pressing enter does nothing
in terms of backups/recovery, you want to avoid having a single point of failure
in terms of haskell they're just a way of composing functions + a little bit more
in terms of performance?
in that case which is better?
in that case, can you flash a custom rom without any bs like unlocking the bootloader?
in that case, i would use alpine, because it is kind of similar in most ways exept for the package manager.
in that money you can have a gramm of shit from my foot
in that sense, rich people are the most miserly tightfisted motherfuckers imaginable
in the 1920s you could buy a plane for the price of a model t, what happened?
in the balls
in the before time.
in the case of the usa this is verisign.
in the cloud, backup drive and device i use obviously.
in the description you find the following string:?tag=education&title=my_cool_video&url= 3
in the early days i thought it was a good idea
in the end you're just putting stuff on tracks.
in the end, it might be like amd in 2015
in the end, the only one winning is schekelberg.
in the gnostic tradition, the monad is the real god.
in the insanely unlikely event that they shut that down you still have your real one.
in the kitchen we call them counters.
in the meantime, there's always lucid dreaming
in the movies and tech tubers make it seem like its pretty much acceptable and sometimes weird if you arent getting a little blazed before and during work
in the netherlands you will get thrown in jail for throwing tea lights at the king's carriage or when you'll make a noise during wwii memorials
in the past business units and clients had more concrete ideas of what they wanted to do, nowadays it's uhh, like make that thing that does that thing, like the facebook messenger but it does this thing you see
in the rest of the world and for the previous 40 years of using a fucking computer, it was called formatting your shit so people can fucking read it.double spacing on reddit doesn't double space, it adds a single line break
in the sense that it can be interpreted 10 different ways, one of them being you can overclock it to good spec, it's binned well, and the other being it does the same thing because it's also ram why do you care about speed, then no
in the server world (which is the only thing that matters, and not your little autism desktop threads) what matters is uptime, not a bunch of retarded features that nobody cares about (known as shiny new stuff syndrome)
in the time that you waste worrying about your monitor setup, real men are doing work
in the us the blm riots have just resulted in communities being ravaged and innocent lives taken away and all for a man who refused to cooperate with the police, died not from the knee placed on his neck but from amphetamine overdose and almost killed a pregnant woman in the past.>hey retard police don't shoot blacks at any higher rate than whites.absolutely, europeans are killed by police on a slightly higher rate when accounting for crime, lack of cooperation, etc., but this is something that the (average) low iq african american doesn't understand
in the very, very least, all that happens to data is being fed to an ai, for whatever reasons, and stored just in case, which is already pretty bad in my book
in theory it was supposed to be developers and sys admins working in sync, but why do that when you can just shelve the sys admins and make the devs take up the slack.
in this case i just value comfort of having it online over privacy and security
in this case, yes.
in this day and age, especially for security related things, math is 1,000% required but those are usually pretty focussed.os's are a lot of work but at the same time, its not ultra complex work.being a good software engineer (not a web dev) requires a good understanding of math
in those almost 10 years, i've fallen for every /g/ meme and flunked out of my cs degree, insisting on doing everything with c and latex on my arch x200, just like the archfag comics i saw so long ago, swore that's not me, i won't become like that, and i became exactly like that

in vue, a ref is a name you apply to an element so you can easily refer to the element within your js.<template> <div> <h1 ref=title>foo</h1> </div></template><script>export default { mounted() { this.$refs.title.innerhtml = bar }}</script>

in windows 10results even differ from instance to instance:https://i.imgur.com/wlyzx9i.png>qwantsame shitty fucking results
in windows, you change the system volume to some value
in your case people upload endless duplicates to whatever video sites you get your riot footage from, and in his case (paid sites) there might also be duplicates because porn sites are sometimes just collections of older content from other porn sites, porn is often re-released under a different name by a different company when another company is dissolved and sells its content off to others.

instead of accessing a device directly, an operating system loads the device drivers and calls the specific functions in the driver software in order to execute specific tasks on the device.
instead of being terminal based, everything is now read in via radio (over something like rabbitmq), parsed in python or c# and displayed in html (and js) using a .net server
instead of delegating your system stability to a bunch of randos, there is always the option of actually figuring that shit out yourself
instead of having to activate it post installation.
instead of making you press the spacebar to peek into a file, it just shows you a file preview in the icon, including for text files and documents.>11
instead of removing it you should just disable it using electricity
instead the main selection that happens is by wealth (of parents) and smart poor kids go through absolute hell, often making them artificially stunted socially
instead there's hordes of people shouting about sjws and nu-devs who don't seem to have much idea what rust (or programming in general) is, but are absolutely sure that it's an invasion of their space.
instead they are under the authority of an imperialistic fake democracy with elites pulling the strings?tool
instead they're building docker images and uploading them to serverless dcs
instead, it can be better to build a copyleft project and advocate for the user while accepting free labor from paid wagies.the resources available to companies are absolutely mind-boggling
instead, it goes out of the way to make mpv work like mplayer.https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/1574using libmpv to embed a rendering context into a gui toolkit is the only sane thing to do
instead, it opens up a microsoft edge window using bing to search for how to adjust brightness..
instead, you get what's hip, what is acceptable to google and what they believe you're looking for based on flawed models and whatnot.let's not kid ourselves: this is done for money and power, and you should face jail time for these particular practices.

intel > supermicro > asus > dfi > gigabyte > abit > tyan > asrock > microstar >>>>>> chinkshitthese days the mobo manufacturer makes less of a difference in quality than in it used to.if you're buying older hardware from roughly 2000-2010 then above list applies.if buying pre-2000 hardware then the choice of chipset and cpu compatibility matters more than the brand itself.sandy bridge and later removed most of the shit manufacturers because alternative chipsets dropped out of the race.
intel and amd both look very competitive but intel has the higher boost frequency

intel cpus have dookie graphics and are riddled with security holes that require huge performance regressions to properly mitigate through bios and windows updates.3000 series ryzen amd cpu laptops are best bang/buck and 4000 series ryzen amd cpu laptops are best performance/buck

intel is in trouble though
intel is only better in gaming in the 2080 ti at 1080p240hz low-setting

it actually gets btfo by iphone in some areas
it actually seems like it might be a good way to have four side buttons in a layout where it's really hard to press the wrong one
it actually works for everything.
it admins of /g/how do you protect higher ups email at your company?im curious if people are really able to just send an email to zuck or the ceo of paypal
it ain't worth it bro
it ain’t got games!
it all depends
it all depends on how you use it
it all depends on your eyes
it all depends on your writing style
it all went to gay flat design when the gay guy tim took over after steve's death.
it allows to increase the compression speed for big 7z archives, if there is a big number of cpu cores and threads
it allows you to create truly serverless applications with high levels of security, reliability, and performance
it already comes without the majority of preinstalled uwp apps.>can you get the ryzen scheduler on ltsc 2019?no, and will never
it already did, like a month ago,now scram
it already does what it's supposed to do.
it already exists, it's called fms but people are too dumb and lazy to install it
it already has everything and there is a reason why a majority of these tech companies use them
it already is obsolete
it also does galleries, zooming, webm videos with sound, and has a scripting section if you find a site that it doesn't work with.>>79399903how is this different from the fanboy cookie list?
it also free up the c: drive.
it also makes it less comfortable to use with the newer island style keyboards
it also means i have to rely on whatever outdated modules they have installed on the server.
it also offers you to generate a pack with security-only updates instead of monthly rollups if that's your thing
it also re-burns any hydrocarbons or soot that escaped the first burn cycle, but this is minor, as it only recirculates about 15% of the total mass flow output of the system.egr is only for emissions related items, it can also be used as a means to improve fuel consumption but its not improving efficiency in most cases
it also simultaneously settled apple's lawsuit against them, which they would have lost.
it always brings shitwares with it
it always ends up more expensive fixing it in the long run.there's also the indian mafia where they'll only hire other indians from their caste
it always is if your purpose is getting a working system
it always seemed mostly logical and reasonable abstraction.>abstractionhere.
it appears you clicked make new thread instead of reply.
it baffles the mind how they could screw it up this bad when it worked fine on every os prior since 95.what image viewing apps do you use instead, /g/?
it basically can't do anything at all
it basically solved all of the problems i had with this.
it beats any mechanical board for pure speed.
it became frequent i asked customer care
it better be or red is dust
it bloats my folder, i need to make a my documents 2 folder for my actual files
it boils down to you're wrong because i say you are>rust will never replace c++
it both dot and adblocking
it by default anyhow runs everything as a different user / group id and largely sandboxed with only access to explicitly defined directories / volumes, and each container gets its own so they can't interact with each other's data either unless explicity allowed.it's just an additional protection
it bypasses the main door console, so i assune its for nefarious purposes, but i cant figure it out (ive sent the device to my boss anyway though)
it came back on a few minutes after plugging it back in, but i noticed the network name changed back to its default, and the security type changed to open
it can appear in a lot of different ways
it can backup your data and reduce the size of email attachments, open and unpack rar, zip and other files downloaded from internet, create new archives in rar and zip file format.
it can barely run chrome + excel and even then it struggles
it can be a battle for sure.
it can be annoying at first, since you can almost never just run a binary without having to set it up so it can find the dependencies.but it still has some niceties, like setting up your window manager is way more straightforward and less error-prone than in arch due to the way things are configured.as a developer, nix (doesn't require nixos, but the experience is nicer) is quite good
it can be either.boards.4chan.org/g/forth
it can be your computer or mobile phone
it can game, it can edit video and some other stuff, and if you need horsepower for heavier stuff, then you would have the budget to upgrade anyways..
it can have garbage colors and whatever i don't give a fuck, 1080p is fine.i'm also a leaf so keep that in mind, it'll fuck with prices and availability
it can improve the compression speed for multi-core processors like threadripper/epyc and xeon
it can occasionally matter when the interface in question can't handle all the data required
it can reach 60c just from browsing 4chan.what do i do /g/ee
it can take years to get an american made app approved to be accessed in china, due to bueorcracy
it can talk to all your hardware, but it doesn't have a user interface, so if you try to run it by itself, it will get all your hardware up and running, and then immediately crash, because even though it's established communication channels with your hardware, it has nothing to say to it.an organization called the free software foundation made a user interface called gnu
it can unpack rar files
it can vary a lot from 0 to quite a damn few
it can't be helped.
it can't be more spyware than windows itself
it cant be that good
it can’t be subverted by jews it has all the essential toolstime and date, stopwatch, alarm, 12 hour and 24 hour modes.not a faggy analog watchdoesn’t spy on you like a smart watchbuilt like a brick basically the 3310 of the watch worldcan be modded to have nfc chipcan be modded to store sd cardssleek 80s look reminds you of a time when computers were for the white manyou’ve never seen a nigger wear one irlcan literally go buy one right now for $15usdso /g/ why don’t you own a casio f91w?
it changes subtle aspects of the biped to maximize a variable (distance walked)that is a research project funded by public money
it claims to encrypt files when uploading to cloud and unencrypt the files on the fly when downloading.
it comes with all the c tools (cc, ctags, yacc, lex, c headers) in a default install.
it confused me too because who the fuck uses this analog onboard trash.
it constantly gets in your way
it contains various info on when an email was sent and the ip of the mails erver or some shit
it controls the input for the screen on the case>>77055719it is pretty cute desu
it cost me between $250 and $300 dollars and it kicks ass.
it costs all of $0.00 to pirate windows.
it could also be because you're an insufferable troll.and finally, you know the rules
it could also freeze unless placed deep enough in somewhere like alaska to make use of more stable underground temperatures
it could be easier to just reorganize your code depending
it could be ok, depending on how active the tutor is though with youyou also can't learn ds&a from other students which it advertises but i can't see any mentions of how much class time there is per week, if any
it could be remembering separately for devices with mic/button (your earbuds, 4 wires) vs devices without (your car, 3 wires)
it could electron as well i don't know...
it could have easily fucked up a pixel, i have a 1440p screen that i dinged, there's a dead pixel right where the ding it but it's clearly a pixel and not an amorphous shape like a cut
it covers more of your vision and it's also not suddenly too small if you lean back in your chair.
it crashes at bootwomm>4
it crunches a lot numbers so it would be really slow in shell/bash
it definitely looks like a hobby project
it depends more on the environment and the people you work with than the actual task
it depends on how you're blocking them
it depends on the situation, but i often have to program things like traffic decryptors, custom unpackers, etc that are tailored for a specific incident that i am working.
it depends on what you're doing with the language
it depends really
it did compile and work as intended after making those changes, however
it did on my gentoo boxes.
it didnt make sense in the short term so we ended up over trading and burying our row of trader in losses
it displayed blue and rend screens depending on your button imputdidnt document anything, never branched out beyond this, never learned to program, joined teh military and long story am a commercial real estate investor now
it does change things; people shouldn't be glorifying george floyd and acting like he's some kind of saint just because the news picked up his death.
it does everything that i want it to do, but i've been itching to upgrade to am4 due to the supposed increase in computing
it does have an unofficial repo with nonfree firmware if you really really need them.
it does have the 7th gen i7 though.
it does if your hardware consists of 10+ year old thinkpads that you bought used from ebay.
it does look cute kinda like the gamecube
it does not go waste it goes to a public company that helps and employ people
it does not matter how furiously shit or super proven how cucked bsd is, /g/ will always use it cause linux got too mainstream, this proves white niggers on /g/ only care about this to look different online
it does not prevent programs to read each others memory.you can run perfectly trusted and secure systems without any virtual/protected memory or even an mmu like for example infernoos.
it does not scale
it does result in a centralisation of computation though.
it does the same after a while lol
it does, but there are existing and better solutions
it doesn't automatically set the upload bandwidth like biglybt
it doesn't come with all the related bug fixes and stability fixes
it doesn't fucking matter if all you ever do is ask other retards on 4chan stupid shit like that, instead of actually learning
it doesn't give the usb root permission dumbass, you have to be root to let it connect to the machine at all, the port is off you need root to turn the port on
it doesn't have to have them
it doesn't make any sense at all, show us your work
it doesn't make sense to me what is the point of moving off the mainstream part of the internet to only interact with fat neckbeards when you could just step away from the entire internet and interact with normal people.
it doesn't make sense.
it doesn't matter because you will see that you were wrong on september 1st.
it doesn't matter how many ssds you throw into raid 0, they'll never be as fast as ram.>>77360465ram will run circles around ssds in random 4kb read/write which is what gets used when you do things like web browsing.
it doesn't matter how smart a compiler is, it still can't do register renaming around subroutine calls, and the only way to even remotely compete with renamed loop iterations is by thrashing your poor in-order instruction cache by unrolling loops to the nth degree.there's a reason itanium only did well on fp in the end, and that's because fp code tends to be very regular, but that's just another nail in its coffin, because that's the exact kind of code that does even better on simd/gpus.
it doesn't matter how well i program if i do things in a way that isn't maintainable by something who just doesn't have the talent and the motivation.the most annoying thing is having to rewrite everything constantly.
it doesn't matter if its legally independent, the point is its indirectly controlled by google, and google's interests shape the browser.you think all that auto-sign in shit, destroying extensions shit, destroying adblock shit is all tabled by engineers to make the browser better for us?
it doesn't matter, there's no gpu available that could drive that for years to come
it doesn't mean they will watch you 24/7, but a mark, boolean or whatever to pinpoint such users from 7 bil to a few hundred thousand is real
it doesn't mean you have to compile anything
it doesn't need to beat the 3090, but if it's competitive at the 3080 range, that'd be a huge upset
it doesn't offer a streamlined workflow like a generic video editor, but it does the basics and if you also do animation (2d or 3d) then you can easily integrate your videos in there.
it doesn't really feel like c++, but good patterns that can be applied in c++ are beaten into you by running clippy
it doesn't really matter how you configure the fan positions.
it doesn't really matter what is shipped in the packages in this case, as the person receiving it has nothing to do with the exchange.
it doesn't run on cucked hardware
it doesn't seem slow yet.
it doesn't send mod keys through correctly
it doesn't start drawing a window in a random point of the screen but let you choose the position before drawing itit is non-intrusive and powerful at the same time
it doesn't support anything.
it doesn't wait forever, it gives a sane timeout (1m 30s usually) then it kills the process.
it doesn't work, can you show me the output on your machine?
it doesn't, just make it bearable for other people, don't do retarded shit like making c look like python and overloading somewhere else
it doesn't, reviews keep mentioning mediocre performance and bad camera.
it doesnt fit anywhere near what i need for work
it doesnt take much these days to get to the top of the list
it doesnt touch as many cs concepts as sicp does, but once you've done htdp, you can learn more by going over the courses that the author teaches here https://felleisen.org/matthias/teaching.html i recommend doing his courses called hack your own language and principles of programming languages, both are on the link i gave
it eats a lot of cpu cycles for such a seemingly basic ui.
it even had a fancy french name, de quervain's tensynonitus
it even took this image and allowed me to start this thread
it exists
it feels like ebay buyers now are just cheapskates honestly
it feels like hodge podge.
it feels sluggish
it fills a very secific niche and robustness isn't one of them
it finally became good enough to replace c
it fits her normie needs
it fixed this annoying bug for me where you have to open an image twice after loading it.
it fucking crashes every time you unplug your fucking headphones.shut the fuck up nigger and never talk to me again.
it gets the point across, it's original music composed for windows xp, movie soundtracks use the same terminology.
it gives you a solid mental model of programming basics but it's very hard to say how valuable that will be for you (or anyone)
it goes back all the way to gtk1.
it goes faster therefore it's better
it got into the elder care homes very early
it got me thinking about cell phones
it gotta have time to send all the photos you see to microsoft cloud before you even see them
it had crashed but gave no indication.you can have the whole game just crash or the whole computer lock up
it handles that and more like plausible deniabilityhttps://www.veracrypt.fr/en/veracrypt%20hidden%20operating%20system.html
it happens, get over it and stop posting, frame the god damn thing and put it on your wall if you want.
it has 20 lanes off the cpu including the 4 that are allocated to the top nvme slot, then 4 that are for connecting the chipset only
it has a great sensor too, i actually feel that it feels more natural than the 3366 in my previous (temporary 1.5-2 year) logitech mouse.
it has aged, but fundamental concepts are never outdated
it has an external chip on the back, which is being covered by an intel cpu stock photo for safety reasons (it's classified)
it has been known for hundreds of years that the best way to wage a war is without weapons, and what better way than to convince a population that weapons are only for aggression.
it has been more than enough for me, desu.maybe lacking a bit for ps3 emulation but that is
it has bromite patches, so it's ungoogled, and it has full codec support.
it has built in adblocking and a working html layout engine and can run netsurf, their engine is a completely different thing and i dont think netsurf is more than 15g
it has held up well imho
it has legitimate medical uses and unlike opioids it's not going to fuck you
it has like 17 sata ports
it has like a 10 gallon per minute flow rate
it has never been confirmed that someone has gotten /marked/ from posting on /ptg/.previously: >>77003279
it has never been confirmed that someone has gotten /marked/ from posting on /ptg/.previously: >>77009923
it has never been confirmed that someone has gotten /marked/ from posting on /ptg/.previously: >>77028495
it has night to do with the brightness of the screen.
it has outlived it's usefulness but it's needed for legacy stuff.
it has proart in the name so you know it's aimed at professional artists
it has stayed relevant for longer than almost any other cpu ever.
it has the comfy terminal and is mostly posix-compliant, correct me if i'm wrong
it has the perfect thrusters for your sides to navigate orbit
it has to stay a budget card forever!
it has wifi, it has a scanner, and i printed a shitload of pages and i'm still on 70% of the toner.
it hasnt fully died until the race war though
it have pedo logo, sorry, i am uninterested.
it helps a lot.
it helps that the zen 2 apus were made using an improved 7nm+ process by tsmc
it helps you build up your physical strength after all
it hit too close to home lmaoat least he liked noah wyle's performance so much that he let him impersonate him in a macworld expo or whatever that event was called
it includes a live cd iso to load up in a vm with a pre-configured environment so that everything the book talks about works without having to deal with shit like >>77034651
it increases the speed of sha-1/sha-256 hash value calculation, the speed of encryption/decryption in zip aes, the speed of key derivation for encryption/decryption in 7z/zip/rar archives.
it is
it is a decoding feature not an encoding feature
it is a fucking meme, like wireless charging for phones.
it is a fucking pisstake
it is a lot easier to qa 10 million lines of code than to qa 1000 million lines of code.to provide variety and utility to users they instead opened up the platform to third party apps and made sure this outsourcing process works smoothly: most new packages are added with a few days of latency (at most a few weeks), app updates are pushed with hours of latency (at most a few days) - basically it goes as fast as the application project wishes to push it
it is a popularity contest when you account for npm
it is active and not dead like irc
it is all just marketing
it is almost never used for that
it is also being used for kung-flu research right now.
it is also often caused by other things than you think
it is an 8-core processor with big-little arrangement
it is an attempt to save their ecosystem
it is an embarrassment to compare freetard software with professional software, and claim that they're somehow usable
it is an fx and compositing program that is supposed to counterpart premiere
it is an io because you can take alcohol up the ass and feel drunk
it is because that's how much high-end portions of the gaming gpu market is willing to bear.the gpu mining craze was one lucky marketing experiment for nvidia/amd and they have hard marketing data proving how much the market is willing to tolerate
it is better to be accurate with such publications.
it is both the cause of, and cute little perfect accompaniment to, them being on welfare
it is essentially the gnu operating system, with the linux kernel
it is extremely interesting, but only for the specific field of programming i'm in
it is fairly saturated
it is fine
it is flying towards washington at an incredible speed.sheiße!
it is for the greater good i swear
it is from moondrop, looks like it's just a painted ssr, but it might have a different tuning?
it is going back to a neo-metal age (mostly metal reclamation) once all of the easy energy has been exhausted.
it is hard to find out what types of programming incur execution speed penalties and what types are fine
it is however 1 mm taller, which makes it stick up higher than the spacebar and likely to mark the screen
it is illegal in most countries, but somehow they get away with it
it is in canada, the more it is in usd the more it is comparatively in cad
it is is either i buy a $200 refurbished to tide me over or i get a midlet computer now
it is just not bright enough and text too blurry for my use now.rip 16:10.time to search for something new
it is known
it is like not using your car to stop humanity from polluting air, makes your life harder for no real benefit to anyone.
it is like nuclear warhead versus hand grenade.
it is made of unbreakable holy matter.st
it is nonsense though.
it is not a thread it is a promise
it is not required in a hcci that usually has advanced vvt to limit air intake
it is only free as long us dominate and control the markets.
it is over
it is part of a trial by elon musk.
it is penultimate and meant for enterprise and business users so it has no bullshit ads or trackers
it is pretty high though.the real problem is shows that were mastered digitally at low resolutions, esp
it is probably why the authorities tolerate it
it is relatively easy to fix popup-kill-ring in term, but i have no idea why popup-menu* is failing to recieve the enter keypress
it is retarded, but don't let that stop you
it is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.> originally built at lyft, envoy is a high performance c++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures
it is still running perfectly fine, chill and makes no noise at all
it is the 64gb model
it is the best feature, i can't even put into words how many wonderful songs that shit introduced to me
it is the manufacturer
it is the pattern and template language of syntax-rules.this paragraph accurately explains the problem with scheme macros
it is the solid bedrock foundation for my entire build and the sole things it's missing is a second usb 3 header and a couple extra sata ports because i already used up all 7 of 8 of em and want to get a couple more ssds.i don't necessarily trust asus but i forget why
it is the year of our lord 2031
it is unprofessional to do pretty much any of these things, and would more than likely damage future business with that client
it is very sad that someone is trying to share something what they think is interesting but no one cares
it is what it is
it is worthwhile.it means you don't have to 'learn' somebody elses fking regex (syntax)regex is a fkign joke
it is, anti-apple kun is retarded
it is?
it isn't
it isn't 2020, stop lyingalso take a photo of it at a different season
it isn't anything and you shouldn't care.
it isn't as simple as you think
it isn't moeshit.
it isn't the best, but it gets the job done.
it just an amdrone meme
it just basically guarantees that you'll be able to playback 8k to 16k video just fine when that comes out.
it just can't get integrated into the linux kernel itself
it just didn't occurred to him that there's a setting to disable that
it just does
it just kinda ironic that you can play most of the games and pirated games on the os you need to pay for to use all of its features and not on all the other free os-es available
it just looks so cool.
it just makes everything easier.
it just needs to look elegant, be stable and quick and i'm happy.windows 10 could achieve such glory if they stopped forcing updates and reverted back to the update model in windows 10
it just seems to be in certain threads on /b/
it just sits on the floor and vents heat out of the window
it just uses tab based hierarchy instead of open/closing tag based hierarchy
it just werks
it just werks even more than ubuntu just werks.there is not a single manner in which mint cinnamon does not just werk.you never have to open up a terminal window if you don't want to.everything a normie could ever hope to do can be done through the gui.you've got a gui app store, gui system updates, intuitive gui file management, gui settings dialog, you've even got gui-based gui ricing instead of modding config files.you can run windows programs ootb, and if you prefer, the app store also has gaymes and multimedia editing software that are available natively.what more are you asking for?
it just werks lol.also, opensuse is the free edition of sles, and sles is basically okay
it just werks....?
it just won't compile on my machine due to some bizarre error.
it just works.
it keeps the calories at bay..
it keeps track of my steps/fappingyeah, i’m cringe incarnate
it kinda sucks how i do want to get education and explore topics(why i chose cs) but some of the stuff i'm interested in doesn't necessarily need it
it lasts for about 30 seconds, then dies
it let's you create a function without a name
it lets anyone become a partner manager, as long as they abide by their political bullshit
it lets you adjust the screen brightness
it literally prevents prostate enlargement and prostate cancer in old age
it literally takes 15 seconds to just right click on the desktop
it litetally doesn't matter unless you are scared of muh ddos
it locked from inside automatically and i had to fix the ac unit because he was too cheap to get it repaired
it looks almost as good as 1080p and your gpu only has to render half the pixels
it looks attractive compared to first gen iphone
it looks better if the second-level is short and snappy
it looks better than word lol.
it looks excellent
it looks fun, and it must be practical for big resource-hungry applications, but who cares?
it looks like absolute ass, either plug on a tv through component or emulate with dolphin.
it looks like it was one of my scripts that prevented it
it looks like it's stuck in 2006.
it looks like the ad.
it looks like the kernel and refind only take 20-32 ish megabytes but i have a bunch of old kernels in there so the disk is close to full
it looks like the run of mill cheap vacuum with no filtering where half ofthe dust will land in your room again
it looks really nice and to me it could make sense temp wise, that middle and 3rd fan isn't getting the heat out of the case.
it looks really small
it looks unprofessional as hell and my ram is being consumed faster than a dead rat's asshole by maggots.
it made me feel nostalgic for some reason
it made my life a living hell yesterday and alerted me to just how evil and awful internet really is with how nasty people get when it's taken from them
it makes absolutely no senset
it makes my head hurt it's so stupid.
it makes requests to facebook.
it makes sense that you'd want styling to be in the most accessible markup language since the odds of a great designer knowing how to program is so low
it makes the sound more analogue.
it makes weebshit sound amazing.
it matters less than you'd think.
it may be related but doesn't have to
it may not be needed in stratified charge ignitions (either compression or spark, such as peanut head idi diesels, or cvcc gas engines)
it may work on your 3ds but don't blame me if it breaks it.
it means i would finally be comfortable writing software to interface with the windows api because its now open source.
it means you're a virgin faggot.it's accurate.
it means you're cucked into choosing low profile components and creating a literal hotbox with components crammed together, the fans will be screaming too.
it might be because of circumcision.
it might be choked for bandwitdth, but it will work.
it might be due covid19, but my resume looks crazy pro (some colleagues say) but i think recruiters laugh when they invest their time reading my resume to find out i only finished high school and i'm trying to compete with people with master degreesfeels bad man
it might be easier to just pass messages or something.>.i don't know how it will play with traits (i have a bunch of box<dyn fn>, box<dyn trait> etc...)you might violate something called object safety, if you use static methods inside of a dyn trait.
it might be news to you, but most people are borderline retarded consumerist whores.
it might be that i view the coding gig through some pink goggles but if i learned it and got good with it, i think i would enjoy it
it might be the resist fingerprinting one.
it might have been too long and you've missed out though
it might help you understand more about how an algo works or other theory things.
it mode turns the card into a dumb port
it must really be embarrassing for those products.
it needs to be nuked
it needs to just work
it never ceases to amaze me how any shit the dykes and trannies try to shit on people with, it just starts getting used ironically
it only finally released there in april this year
it only gets worse the older the intel the cpu is.
it passed all checks
it pays a decent salary
it prevents someone from having your files whether it's been formatted or not.
it probably has at least 16gb of emmctry something lightweight like lubuntu i guess
it probably isn't going to be ok, but don't loose hope.
it probably makes production a lot easier, but it basically gives the same experience as any other face commentary/stream, i don't get the appeal.
it probably will make it just hard enough where not more will stop using it but if you really wanted to it wouldn’t be hard to use
it probably won't last 10 times longer either
it puts it back whenever you try to remove it.
it ran wordperfect 5.0, which is still the best software ever written for a writer, i think
it randomly crashes with webms.like, how the fuck does a webm crash a web browser?fuck mozilla and fuck trannies, join the 41%
it really depends on the case and scenario
it really depends on what you're using them for, an nvme 970 pro for example won't make games load 100x faster than a sata mx500 but the later will croak if heavily multi-tasking and being used as page file (ie virtual ram) all at once.
it really depends on your case flow
it really disgusts me to have to look at them in the catalog.
it really do be like that
it really isn't
it really makes me upset that this board skips such great, well developed and great documented os such as freebsd just because of licence.txt
it really ought to go without saying that a good recommendation for doing anything, not just smart-home stuff, in a privacy respecting way is don't try to use a smartphone to do it in any way shape or form
it reminds me of me when i was 12 and used to rice windows 7 but this is peak levels of autism and reddit söy.
it reminds me of the first iterations of the 3930k cpus on the x79 platform where intel forgot to enable vt-d on the chips and only in the later steppings like c0 i think?
it requires 5 clicks
it runs extremely deep and all google cares is about is money and responsibility placed by governments internationally, our media does not
it runs hot but it works and if i was just on the laptop screen i could run high no problem
it runs in the background, without a dedicated buffer, and you can control it from emms.>and it handles metadata for youemms handles metadata too
it runs like complete shit
it runs the computations it hasn't cached on the database, on the server, and the performance dip is visible.
it says brainneedle
it says can, not you can
it says its for ssd but should work right?em7455 for t430 on ivyrain.
it says niggers tongue my anus
it says there, nvdec
it seemed like tech was getting really cool without getting tool dystopian
it seems awesome but annoying to have to install via docker
it seems faster and more ergonomic to just create a backup and then make the change manually in your sql editor of choice so you don't have to stop the rails server to rails:db migrate every time.
it seems kinda nice, do you guys recommend it or not really?
it seems like a good idea but is it worth it in practice?
it seems like it's a thing
it seems like owners can actually remove other owners so github is this retard
it seems like the new hotness, but it may be buzzword crap
it seems really cool, but so far all i get is a blue screen saying system initializing.
it seems that most of the usage comes from actually drawing that plot of the usage, because if i scroll down so the plot is out of frame, usage drops to under 25%.
it seems they just blast the treble to artificially gain detail, which ends up making it sound harsh / fatiguing
it seems to be pretty unstable and i would like it to be more lightweight.is gentoo really a meme?
it seems to me it's very wasteful on my hard drive, i'd rather download it to the ram, is this possible?
it seems to work very well, and they give out free pro trials like candy.
it seems too good to be true, i assume installing tor browser is just as backdoored as using an intel me chip?from what i've read about tor, it seems like that's the case, no different from installing a proprietary bios or intel me.a piece of government-built software, disguised as being for another purpose.
it sets up an environment for the cpu to interpret it
it shat the bed
it should
it should be 5.
it should be capping out at 540ish mb/s, so what is happening here?
it should be more robust in the event of weird circumstances like *vterm-popup-kill-ring* already existing for whatever reason
it should be since bureaucracy is moving online
it should have been taken a step farther where sage in the comment field should have also implicated it into the email field
it should run pretty well on an s7.ps: you can skip installing twrp, as it's pretty much bloat (for the average joe at least).
it should update 20 times per second, but for some reason it's a little bit slower.
it shouldn't
it shouldn't be too difficult to get new maintainers
it solves all the unix problems with a small set of composable easy concept that when combined togheter are amazingat the same time, they kept it similar enough to unix at the surface
it somehow reminds me of this
it sounds like it is moaning and is quite loud when gaming
it sounds like you require supervision.
it spans across multiple websites that specialize in multiple content types
it started happening sfter i installed i3-gaps
it starts to lag form time to time and the battery has gotten pretty shitty but other than that it's still great.
it still makes me really mad that this website of all places uses google and doesnt allow posting from a vpn or proxy
it still works no problem though
it stopped interesting me, especially when libraries exist
it sucked then and it still sucks in the current year
it sucks now that i got a job and afford fancy new hardware, i lost my interest in gaming
it supports multiple channels (that riot does not have)>b-but riot (is now known as element) supports multiple channels just create multiple servers and group them together !!shut the fuck up.gonna cry ?
it sure as shit isn't public trackers, i have gathered that much.
it surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition) that the symbol abs names a procedure for computing the absolute value of a number
it takes 1 second on the ssd, and 3 seconsd on the 5400rpm hard drive.my productivity has gone to shit, and i've lost my job and wife as a result.
it takes 15-20 minutes on my shitty core i3 laptop with ccache on
it takes longer to extract due to cabs and bad compression:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1a4e5b67060ff2bc8fe2de36a6c265c77f392a0c
it takes only an small shitstorm to fill up the entire catalog, you would have to wait until the storm is over to have a small niche thread.also 4chan does not develop circle jerks but board culture.
it takes source code written in one language, i.e
it takes upwards of 30 seconds for this piece of shit software to start sometimes
it teaches you programming
it teaches you to cast magic spells
it teaches you wizard magic
it ties to their hardware plans too
it took me about 8 hours to implement the first time around in node.js, starting from knowing absolutely nothing to having a working program on a server i set up specifically to host it.the same shit took me three fucking days to do in rust, even though all the hard parts were already done and all i was doing was trying to replicate functionality
it took them 35 years to introduce ctrl + click to deselect a selected cell (only for office 365 subscribers.) truly revolutionary.
it truly baffles me how so many criticize people for, for example, buying the newest hardware, or for being excited for new movies, games, and products
it truly is programmer-brainrot.
it turns grey when i go into chrome, but what is it blocking?
it used to be cheaper with a promo
it used to be my main audio output, but i've moved on to bigger and better things
it used to be something teenagers could figure out in a weekend.
it uses fucking 2w of power.
it uses hardware fingerprints to track you
it uses his automated script to set up a lot of things, so i do think it's worth going back and looking into what everything does and how it works after the fact
it was 150 million.
it was 23gb and on mega so i didn't grab it.would be interesting if there are fragments of code we need on it.
it was 90% spot on about all ryzens
it was a 5.5 year old 970
it was a different version than the windows one, normally a few versions behind
it was a hacky mess.at least you could link stuff back than
it was a mass surveillance plan literally right from the start
it was a small company
it was already delayed to q1 2021 a few weeks ago
it was always soulless
it was an absolute blessing when divx/xvid/mpeg-4 happened.
it was an early attempt that created an ecosystem for kubernetes, podman, lxd, ...the containers weren't very bad and something needed to start this.
it was an extremely capable machine that could have up to 32gb of ram and a quad core i7 albeit with a mostly obsolete quadro cardw series is definitely a shout if you need lots of ram, look into dell precision laptops too as they are good too and can go cheap sometimes.
it was an xp machine so i presume it was an issue with long file names, but instead of fucking about with it i grabbed a live usb, booted xubuntu, copied the folder xp refuse to copy from my flash drive then (as one file was a .zip) extracted it before rebooting into windows)
it was basically like yepp, you are on this planet
it was better back then because the comment section wasn't censored and people made 3 min videos straight to the point
it was better then
it was clear he does not give a shit about other channels and ethics at all
it was completed and perfectedunlike some horrible bloated shit and slow as fuck called kuroba
it was cool while it lasted until it blew up under my pillow while i was sleeping.
it was expensive but i don't care since it does exactly what i needed.
it was formatted hfs+, which her new windows 10 computer can't read
it was fucking awful but worked.
it was fucking awful.
it was fucking terrible
it was getting to the point where i had to constantly look at my configs to remember how shit was set up to work, because i couldn't just leave things alone
it was gook moot that changed it, not dick cheese
it was invented by some us-based political think tank that helped intervene and destroy many countries all over the world.
it was just html.
it was like i went down this rabbit-hole where i was becoming obsessed with finding the most complex solutions for creating the jankiest computer experience ever
it was low end when it came out 3 years ago
it was made by stupid people who disrespect computer science.
it was me, all along
it was me.
it was more an observation of the developers themselves, so i'm still gonna recommend you lrn2read
it was never our intent and we are not the only site affected
it was not a personal account and was signed up with temp email
it was not advisable to run more than one hard disk intesive application at the same time, but you could certainly run word or some other productivity software whilst running an installer.
it was not facing that constellation in 5000bc.
it was not off, after changing that setting to the correct value i compared with various image viewers and programs and it was visually identical on all of them.and with the new monitor it just worked ootb, so it may depend on your hardware.
it was not the book that he was denouncing.
it was on his own fucking memoirs
it was one claim that was stated by competutor.
it was pretty interesting stuff anyway, and i worked with some seriously smart people.but>webdevi would rather cough up blood than do that full time
it was pushed hard on the most used website in the world
it was shit, but that's what made me think and solve stuff
it was the same for like 10 years and then they changed it whyyy
it was too chaotic now you have to say his name for him to respondhis name is averagegfag
it was unstable, crashy garbage that leaned on the bios and dos for most things
it was useful 10 years ago but apple put all the good tweaks into ios so why bother now
it was way easier to get a job back then and the only reason to move out of your home town was to make an insane amount of money if you got lucky
it wasn't even resisted like the headphone jack
it wasn't flashy, and as a result it had low power consumption.i've genuinely never heard of one of these things dying to heat
it wasn't taken away from me, i willingly moved past it.i happy await what is to come.
it wasn't until 3 months after graduation that i actually found employment in my small flyover state
it wasn’t supposed to be sold- it’s actually imperative this person is found asap
it wass passable with dillo and links.
it went into the exact opposite direction: apple/ios and google/android consist of around a hundred tightly integrated core packages only, managed as a single well-focused project
it will allow for new technologies to be tried out for building and supplying material goods to said city
it will also be used for stuff like weather & seismic simulations
it will be a while before they reach beta probably.
it will be better for everyone if all niggas are sterilized
it will be competitive like blender and krita to some extent
it will be deduct from salary by the boss excuse >>79356421• anon gets the ever popular waifuduino >>79356976• of course devboard anon shows up >>79357301• anon finishes up painting his mini resing figure >>79363594 thin your paints • anons foosball table board arrived broken >>79364140• anon got the baseus stepless dimming lamp >>79364279previous thread >>79308867
it will be like chatting with a real life /g/ user.let me know if you like him
it will be once plasma becomes stable
it will bring forth a new wave of communication spoofing, not unlike the old phone phreaks.
it will drive the expansions of cities and suburbs outwards, instead of concentrating everyone into a single point (which in turn makes them targets for attacks and furthers divisions in society as the rural view the cities as congregations of x belief and the countryside as y belief)
it will enable a more time efficient work environment for the creators of today and tomorrow, if they can take advantage of it.
it will force the expansion of the transportation network outwards, in turn driving electrification of transport, improvement to grid & energy, etc
it will help you keep focused on increasing your skills>take difficult tasks that look good on your resume
it will randomly just lose history results for no reason.i want to go to firefox but i was trying to find if there was another version of it that might be more acceptable
it will then burn through an incredible amount of ink cleaning itself
it will werk
it won't be the same knowledge as what you've learned trough making your own stuff as they will be expecting juniors from college with minimal experience and understanding.persistence and perseverance : even with a degree not every company will take you up, some interviews will be too difficullt and you will fail, but you can use them as practice.this will depend of course on your location, e.g if they are hungry for talent and you know what to do they will over look quite a lot of things and vise versa.>not want to kill myselfcan't figure this out for myself let me know if you do
it won't be you, that's for sure
it won't fly in the eu for sure.
it won't happen in our lifetime
it won't matter unless you're actually important and just basic server hardening and patching is all you'll need.
it won't pay very well though, and you'll have to deal with small company bs and you'll get bored if you have actual interest in tech.
it wont take long ;))
it worked fine until it switched off instantly
it worked for me
it worked for my son.
it works - macosgui - windows 7
it works and gets work done.
it works and it's getting better day-by-day
it works best on linux, but yeah the rx 480 wipes any console in terms of performance at ultra 60fps
it works better for everyone.the proposition has not changed in that-the assumption of free space acoustic load is identical for both tweeters and woofers.-the treatment is done in the limit of large wavelengths relative to the driver.-that sound can be approximated as perturbations in a continuous medium.the scale has changed, but not enough to impact these assumptions
it works fine.what is the problem with msi?
it works great
it works great.
it works perfect (even the battery is at 100%), excepting for the cracked screen and the ring/silent button.what could i do with this phone?
it works really well for female vocals though not-very-forward male vocals in metal can get lost in the midbass.
it works well when cleaning a window with lots of gunk too.i like to use a sponge with vim to clean the gunk off a window then use a dry smooth cloth to do the fine cleaning.but yeah overall a great product i mean its advertised for sinks and the bathroom but honestly comet works better.
it would also be easy to compare different ranking services
it would also look less disgusting.how do i annoy the standard library people into implementing this?
it would also matter if you're even allowed to tinker with implants/prosthesis
it would appear the majority of computers used at a desk are not single board computers
it would be a fun weekend project, and it's botnet free.
it would be boring because i have no friends.
it would be if they dropped gnome
it would be intended to be used as a tool
it would be like a small form factor usb-c pd powerbank, instead of pd voltage specification, it's just 1.5v.tho, your wireless microphone might not like a switching 1.5v source
it would be nice to see simplification of the models but i just don't see ngreedia doing this
it would be perfect
it would be very expensive to dig a trench to lay cable for this.
it would be way too easier to just lie to myself and call richard stallman bad things, but i'd rather do what is meaningful instead of what is expedient.
it would cost me 266bucks and an additional 300 for a new mobo, i would use the 64gb ram of of my old pc but then what do i do with the 2700 and the old mobo?
it would have been better to just immediately get a normal job at a normal company and rebuild myself that way.
it would have been doomed either way due to the arrival of better languages.but perl 6 killed it
it would have changed from free to bound.) the meaning of good-enough?
it would have these features:- 64 bit compatibility- major stability improvements (on par with linux)- able to run windows 7 binaries nativelywhat would happen to the gnu ecosystem?
it would have to be a radeon card because nvidia does not play ball with linux.
it would make sense for something like bluetooth devices, but in the case of the 3.5mm jack it isn't like any information is being transferred to the phone, just out of the phone.with that said, sometimes it fucks up and doesn't properly remember, which is what prompted this thread
it would match a directories and ignore hidden files.>>77695861true but just wrap the `` in .
it would mean your laptop wouldn't be able to finish a movie without the battery dying.
it would suck though
it would take me about 2-4 hours, maybe less to set all of this up an any linux machine
it would work with every serious human being if he wasn't 5yo
it wouldn't hurt to put it in the ups though would it?the modem is also connected to a coaxial cable which runs outside
it wouldn't let me not answer and it wouldn't let me register with a cock.li email fuck
it'd also have to be intact, no breakage of the neck.they'd actually cut off the neck partway down, and attach a new neck with new heater/cathode/control grids/getter(s)/etc, re-evacuate the whole crt, and (somehow; never actually saw this done!) 'weld' the new assembly onto the crt, so it was all one piece again
it'll be a nice challenge for you.
it'll be at least another decade before we start seeing riscv laptop/desktop cpus
it'll be completely fine for 1440p for the long haul
it'll be nice to see if we get full interpolation, but we might not because making consumers get stronger gpus is very lucrative
it'll give it to you
it'll have a year or two of brands coming out with them (moto, lg, htc guaranteed to copy samsung), none of them will sell well due to quality issues and it will fade to a remember those retarded things like modular phones or physical keyboards.
it'll probably be fine when they finally switch over to arm, but otherwise it's garbage.
it'll take years to be developed enough to be useful>scratched with nails>not even dust resistant>you see where it is folded>horrible pricetag
it's 1.44 megabytes
it's 13-15k more of what you get in italy for the same role
it's 1909 currently right?
it's 1995
it's 2020
it's a badly optimized game, it doesn't run well on my i5 9400 either, and i use a 1660s and the game is on an ssd.
it's a beta, shit changes way too frequently otherwise to pinpoint the root.
it's a big case so it can easily fit one but it's expensive.
it's a bunch of rocks stacked together.
it's a case-by-case thing.it also gets you into contact with a few paradigms you may not be familiar with yet (functional programming, lazy evaluation, declarative/logic programming) and some concepts (language implementation, register machines).i think this is the more valuable part but you can go straight for haskell, prolog, assembly if you already have strong basics.the language implementation part is nice because it goes straight for the meat and doesn't bother with parsing
it's a classic problems in computing, and it still holds true even for gpus
it's a coin toss between the iphone 11 pro, or the samsung s20 ultra
it's a collection of .bats, you can just open it on notepad...the few binaries that are used are either microsoft signed or completely unused
it's a common project for second/third year electronics students
it's a considerably improvement but ryzen 4000 is coming in a few months so if you've waiter 6 years already why not wait a little longer
it's a damn shame.
it's a decent deal.
it's a decoding test you massive mong
it's a dual boot set up
it's a fantastic read every cs major should go through in-depth, however it's an advanced material
it's a final with tables and views and stored procedures
it's a flagshship s10 - it gets all the same updates as the rest of the s10 line.
it's a floaty ring y'idiot
it's a gaming one!
it's a good setup for coding, reading, browsing and every related activity
it's a great language but i couldn't find a job in it
it's a highly customized linux mint cinnamon install
it's a huge hassle
it's a large digital workout screen, and it feels like the home gym alternative built for the pandemic
it's a little old now.i7 6700hq12gb ram1060 6gbmy desktop motherboard recently died so i'm waiting on that
it's a long shot but i've fixed nintendo screens like that before
it's a long sweater you dork.
it's a meme
it's a meme, you dip.zoom newfags here think it's le h4x0r speak and they fit in, but it's the same shit as calling everything an app
it's a microphone, so please remove it asap.
it's a monolithic userland layer, just like systemd
it's a mystery.>>77099123i don't mean any offense, you seem like an interesting person outside of the deskop (which i've said i dislike a bunch already.) i'm sure you have your reasons for using it for so long, but i just don't get the appeal
it's a new workload that you can just throw computing power at, for now
it's a noteworthy feat making it through even one article without cringing yourself unconscious.
it's a package manager that allows rollbacks and reproducible builds, plus other stuff
it's a perfect fit for medium to large scripts
it's a phase at best, i went through it when i was 16, i eventually settled on debian with xfce4 and i've been using it for like 8 years nowi never liked ricing, too much of a chore
it's a photoshopped gook
it's a processor, how can it suck?it literally can't fail
it's a program made in a pre-unix world, and its refused to take on many quality of life features because that would mean you can't run emacs on your vax machine
it's a protocol not an product.
it's a protocol, it has multiple apps
it's a qwerty keyboard so by default it is the slowest typing speed possible
it's a retarded metric - you are better off checking your cholesterol, bodyfat % and blood sugar instead.
it's a rewrite that uses geckoview/quantum to make it close to desktop firefox.the performance is better, but the tradeoff is that extension support is minimal and currently by mozilla whitelist-only.
it's a set and forget kind of thing.
it's a shame all the zoomers couldn't figure out how to wiggle it to unplug and reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed so hard they made a new plug
it's a shame it's discontinued.>>78587440>t150wtf, it used to be much cheaper here
it's a shame that your gpu doesn't have a backplate but overall it looks breddy nice otherwise
it's a shitty case but i kind of want one again
it's a shoop...

it's absolute pain to set up an e-mail server and on top of it you're immediately going to land in spam boxes of everyone you reach out to

it's actually a pretty badass pc for it's time and i get compliments on the onboard led's everytime i'm out in public with it
it's actually based on https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.html
it's actually good and completely detached from all other des.
it's actually made in japan by seki edge with thousand-folded japanese stainless steel
it's actually meant to be used with standing desks too i believe, and you can raise it quite high
it's actually useful as a handful of applications can go a much longer way
it's all 27 and larger.it's like consumers don't realize a larger screen requires you to sit further away.
it's all a big ploy to drive wages down
it's all about courage and freedom>the courage to apply an update without knowing whether the jailbreak for this one will work>the courage to buy a new one in a couple years when it gets throttled>the freedom to move data easily between it and any other apple device with only minimal amounts of dongles>the freedom not to be able to use an sd card>the freedom not to be able to use normal earphonesandroid simply cannot measure up

it's almost as ifelseif elseifelseif
it's already easy to learn and you can do fullstack shit with it using asp and blazor
it's already going on
it's already starting to get cold here.no i'm not even being sarcastic
it's also a perfect example of a dead platform.>>windows mobile was a better os>no it wasn't.maybe that's just my nostalgia glasses but i remember wm5/6 more fondly
it's also bridged with the discord server i linked :)i don't get the point of running your own ircd then, if you still have to connect specifically to freenode or ircnow
it's also have its own platform (android).maybe if the fags in sf could stay with firefox os after the first few failed models, but it's easier to stay in comfort zone and wait for the inevitable end
it's also not surprising he is trying his hand at being an eceleb youtuber; sociopaths and narcissists are over represented in that line of work.
it's also when we started seeing massive commercial entities growing, and knew that the beginning of the end was occurring.wild west internet was the bbs days and right after.

it's better than any freetard garbage.you never want to use freetard hobbyist shit on your desktop
it's better than gn*me but kde is still better
it's better to get a flagship phone 2nd hand as it can last a lot longer (provided the bootloader is unlocked or you don't mind the older software).
it's better to write more verbose but plain code than smart code.
it's black
it's bloated as fuck and despite the intent the practice of delaying updates actually makes it more unstable, especially if you use aur a lot
it's borderline trades at the entry level and after time and work you move up to engineer but most network guys get started running cable, climbing ladders, and installing shit on roof tops at construction sites while other techs get started by answering phones at help desk.
it's bright enough that it shines through the tape so i can still tell if it's lit up, but it makes it dim enough that it doesn't get in the way.
it's by my understanding far less botnet than chromium itself
it's called 4chan.>>77031031sounds pathetic, but work burnout is real
it's called a clitoris and yes it's basically a mini hidden penis
it's called a gpu driver you fucking moron
it's called freedom of choice you nigger
it's called larping son
it's called not having a computing device (still your private info gets leaked due other people)
it's called plum i think?
it's called renamehttps://linuxhint.com/rename_files_linux/
it's called ubuntu and it's real.
it's called uninstalling
it's called wakanda op
it's candy, take a bite out of the blue thing.
it's carbon fiber so it can be as light as absolutely possible because this is important apparently.
it's cast as in casting a spell retard
it's catering to retards who refuse to use different tools for different tasks.
it's cheap and it sounds great.
it's codebase quality and design choices are like it was created by total beginner
it's comfy
it's comfy, and it's cool to be able to chat with my friends on something big tech doesn't control
it's coming on 20 years and i still can't forgive myself.get your head out of your ass op.
it's coming with a 128gb ssd, and i have some spare ram that will get it up to 8gb
it's complete bullshit
it's completely frozen, and i'm sick of rebooting every time this happens aaaaaaaaaa
it's completely technocratic the way it works.
it's conceivable that it might carry that in the future, but not now.
it's convoluted trash that has been around too long and built around the concept of 'a little something for every feature request.'
it's cool but i need dwm in wayland, not i3
it's crucial (heh) i get 32gb but i'm looking for something around that price.
it's curly brace because i hate semantic whitespace languages, other than haskell where it's unobtrusive.
it's currently just been built up as an x99 system.the case fits upto 10.7 e-atx btw
it's customizable and stable as well, so basedstemd fanbois and openrceethers can share the same distro love together.
it's debbie+ian a portmanteau of the creator's first name and his girlfriend are the time
it's demoralizing not being able to respond to all of it properly
it's different than just buying a new better cpu even though the old one was working just fine
it's difficult for me to even begin to think of those as actual people, and not just a number
it's disgusting
it's disgusting.this isn't a problem
it's dogshit slow.literally no advantage over linux.
it's dsa
it's e27-socket>>77452637 a lot of leds >>77452651 >>77452676 >>77452686>>77454893 anon's inner jew did some bad things>>77455562 neocities anon posts changes>>77455670 >>77460057 anon's hump buddy comes home
it's easier and cheaper to buy their latest phones, redmi note 9s/pro or whatever they decide to call it is a good one to go with now
it's easier to just hit ctrl+alt+down than constanly look left and right.
it's easy as fuck to make a protonmail account
it's easy to change the wait time to a much shorter time, and at the same time there are legitimate reasons not to
it's easy to waste time looking around on the web, shitposting on chatrooms/forums, etc.working offline gets rid of all that stuff while letting you focus
it's easy, bro; listen to the b2dusk and see if you like it
it's either incompetence or malice.
it's either sell it to microsoft or get fucked.
it's either that or the pajeets over at quora anon.
it's even more of a stretch than saying a 3600 and 3600x do the same thing.>calling people esl because you're shit at making coherent statementsagain, please, shut the fuck up.
it's even too complicated for client sites
it's even worse in python where there is no ternary operator.also>tfw no if on the end of expressions>tfw no unless>tfw no ruby sugarrust seems pretty cool
it's every governments core desire to have a dumb majority populace to control the productive minority, thus why the fbi lies about things like good backdoors and thus why the chinese government lies about tai chi giving you superpowers
it's expensive gaymer shit actually
it's extremely clear and open sounding compared to normal iems
it's extremely inelegant and encourages all the worst practices.
it's fact that 40% of all internet-traffic is non-human
it's far more likely that you learned less from your ba and thus are unfit for the job than employers caring or even noticing.
it's faster and cheaper
it's federated, you can host your own instance and communicate with people on other instances seamlessly
it's feminism, transgenderism and faggotry against everything else
it's fine feller, we are here to help!
it's fine for server and industry use, but it's completely useless as a desktop os.on justworkos you just go to a website, download a dmg file and you're done.on linux you have a central repository that only has a few hundred programs and all of them months out of date, which makes sense for a server, but not for desktop use where 100% stability isn't the top priority
it's fine if you never use the machine for shopping or banking
it's fine practice to use both.
it's fine that it doesn't bother you, it didn't bother me either, but i just went from gentoo running on a t420 (with 3gb of ram) to gentoo on a 3900x + 32gb of ram and holy shit gcc compiles in 20 minutes
it's fine to like a company but all this only benefits the company itself and not you, if you're married with apple go for it but you cannot prove me wrong regarding that if it happens what you want you're simply happy about your company crippling the line of products you used to buy for the sake of owning the freetards
it's fine with my 40 gigabows of ram.
it's firefox
it's firefox.
it's floating!!!!!
it's focused on performance (fewer context switches due to more configurable system calls), backwards compatibility and extinsibility via facilities like com and the registry.since microsoft constrols the os and there are no weird distributions, programs have a standardized set of advanced functionality they can rely on.unix neckbeards can never agree on common standards, they end up bikeshedding forever
it's for a note 9, used to stay away from samsung cards cuz i heard failure, but now i'm hearing the opposite
it's for condensated water usually, but there's so litte that it barely improves efficiency as is
it's for fags and mentally disturbed people like trannies
it's for people who are scared of computers.chromeos can't possibly break because there's nothing meaningful you can change.
it's foss software, not something that would really be covered in a cs course
it's free and that's all that matters.
it's free, meaning it's shit
it's fucked, dead pixels are a sign of bad screen damage, it might even expand if you're not careful.
it's fucked, you should get something past system initializing even if you don't have the peripherals sounds like whatever firmware it has got corrupted or something, you might want to try harvesting the hdd, or you could try repairing it but this kind of stuff looks like it's too niche for anyone to care so you would be on your own
it's fucking hilarious, what is going on?
it's full of rednecks that jerk off to ballmer pics.
it's fun for a bit of a challenge but not having basic stuff on hand really pushes you towards consumerism
it's functionally the same as any other three prong plug, but it also looks like the least painful to accidently step on in the dark.can not argue.
it's funny how all these tiktok shill threads follow the ccp-provided online propaganda guidelines
it's funny, because before amdgpu your only choices were the nvidia web drivers and fglrx, which managed to suck even worse than the present windows drivers
it's garbage
it's gnu, but for windows and binary compatible.
it's going to be like when iran blasted the us base and he began shitting his pants afraid of starting a war with them but worse cause they can actually ko him.
it's going to be more expensive than a 3.5mm but worth the cost in quality
it's good enough for the piece of paper, but i'd like to polish it up a bit
it's good for c and shell scripting
it's good for niche things
it's good for the people buying new parts at that specific time.but considering super was released when amd had nothing to compete with, hopefully nvidia feels threatened enough not to risk amd pulling a ryzen on them and focus on dropping the new architecture sooner than most people hope.
it's good there's the possibility of choice too, so that everyone can have what they prefer.>>77399925bookmarks placement in previous version (new tab) was slightly annoying to me at first, but i learned to like it
it's good to have a copy of something because you never know when it might get taken down due to copyright strikes or big tech censorship.
it's good, but not that good.i heard that how to design programs is supposed to address some of the problems with sicp (in fact, it's the result of a paper constructively criticizing it), but i haven't read it, so i don't know how it is.with that said, the problems with sicp have to do with how it teaches some things, but not what it teaches
it's good, especially for $85 they're asking.i'd choose a georgi over it tbqh, but that's just me being wierd
it's gookmoot blocking it with robots.txt before he bought the website it had archived boards back to like 2004
it's got a few weeks left and i'm emotionally destroyed
it's got some shit features and some useful bells and whistles, but the question is, why?
it's got such beefy specs but holy shit every update just makes it slower and slower and now multitasking is almost impossible as the phone aggressively kills every app
it's gpl3.
it's great
it's great and it was cheap
it's great at work too; rather than spending half a day helping a new engineer get the app running and fucking around with getting the right versions and having to compile certain things because they're not distributed by binary anymore or some bullshit, i can just tell them to install nix and run nix-shell.i would recommend just using nix on your preferred os, and getting comfortable using that before diving into nixos.
it's great, until they remove some song you like because of some bullshit label wants more shekels or it's not available on your region
it's grindr
it's gud
it's happening
it's hard to imagine a mouse being much better than the 305.
it's his server that he is paying for and that he is granting you access to, he can do whatever the fuck he wants, this is what it means to be federated
it's honestly a pretty neat idea.
it's how the web should have been done in the first place
it's how they prevent each other from collapsing.
it's humane, nobody will die, nobody else will be born a nigga
it's hurts imo, that's why i use caps lock as backspace on regular keyboards.what's your budget?
it's illegal to directly threaten the shitty leader, just like in every other country in the world
it's important to have the right practical knowledge and experience to get started in a career, sure, but if you want to get anywhere and have some job security then you need to play the social game.
it's impossible op
it's impossible to fabricate such metaphors in fiction.
it's impossible to know if you are running in a virtual machine
it's impossible to make a keyboard with so little key travel feel nice
it's in marijuana and cbd only bud is still cannabis
it's in principle even more trustworthy than the binaries to be found on eloston
it's in that woolyss linkhttps://chromium.woolyss.com/#android
it's in the 3070 and 3080?can i buy 4 3080s and train a model on them with maximum gpu space and power fully utilized?
it's in the middle of nowhere.
it's in the middle so you can use it as a trackpoint to browse 4chin while spinning that shit like a true dj
it's included with gentoo.
it's incredibly adorable.>>77061551>>77060903> i only use docker because my favorite twitter nobody says they're great and that i should use it because i'm too mentally retarded to manage a simple vps without causing giant security holes to open up> yes, i iz dat gud @ compooting and thingshigh levels of estrogen: detected
it's interesting, and entirely predictable, that they'd sooner cut a quarter of the workforce than seriously trim exectuive salaries.
it's just a copy of my engine with a counter declared already, thats basically the only difference
it's just a custom recovery for power users iirc
it's just a fact
it's just a hyper niche language
it's just a phone
it's just a shitty game in the end, sadly.
it's just a smaller s2, though where i live it's priced just 5€ from the p500a which is just better
it's just a thing you'll get a feel for after some practice.
it's just a tiny light on a long skinny power button, but area-for-area it outshines the monitor on its brightest setting
it's just another shit bait/circlejerking thread for the amdtards.
it's just autism that tells you to repost memes ad infinitum
it's just confy as fuck
it's just decent
it's just genuinely fun.
it's just not designed to just work out of the box, but they give you all the components, instructions (admittedly, full of jargon and assuming prior knowledge, so it's not really normie-friendly), and you have to build it yourself.if you don't like the diy aspect to it, and you want/need something that just works, then there are alternatives
it's just not something we talk about
it's just o'reilly
it's just one album, i'm talking about an entire album
it's just one of the reasons rust is not to be taken seriously
it's just simple state saving, wow xbox can do something that people programmed in assembly micro code 50 years ago so amazing
it's just some e-celeb insulting some random faggot for no visible reason.he could at least have pretended to explain and say why the e-celeb did what he did
it's just straight up cope posting and it's moronic and annoying.
it's just talk
it's just that consumer electronics can't do this, it's basically just r&d crowd control stuff.
it's just that hoi in itself is rather boring and if you play enough of it, it doesn't matter which one it is, it'll get stale rather quickly for the rest of your life
it's just that it's always easier to come up with centralized solutions to the same problems.decentralized solutions always exist, but naturally carry the burden of good design because you can't just change it once it's out.people also often find centralized solutions to be more appealing to due a bad tendency to idolize, so to speak
it's just the stupidest shit i've ever seen
it's just ubuntu but gay?
it's kind of fun and lets you do stuff like manually pack your structs or goof off with manually controlling lists.
it's kind of pointless for home stuff
it's kinda like what you would find in an office, before they switched to cheap business class laptops
it's kinda old and should probably be junked.
it's klwp
it's led to some interesting meetings that's for sure.
it's less bad that people sometimes got their feelings hurt than it is to institutionalize a means by which dissenting opinions are crushed under the rubric of “not nice”.is he right?
it's light and feels faster than ff
it's like 7 feet tall>walking through convention>suddenly me and my pals see a kid running from something>this orange thing is chasing him>pauses>looks at someone else who's staring at it for a couple of seconds>starts running after him
it's like a broken record>i tried $shittyneckbearddistro and it didn't work properlyuse ubuntu you cunt.
it's like a gazelle
it's like calling a person who makes hammers also a construction worker.
it's like i can't fully function unless i take a nap
it's like i'm talking to a retard whose peabrains got stuck in the year 2011
it's like linux, except everything works and people will actually respect you if you did some work in a coffee shop
it's like mutual masturbation, but with a coworker not with a qt fwb
it's like people are goldfish and have 8bit memory
it's like rubbing an infection, it will be better if you did nothing lolwhy am i even replying to this thread i am an idiot
it's like someone tried it once, saw it ran like shit on windows and returned it
it's like star trek and sheeit.> start testing...> oh no no nononononoonooo> huge ping response times> fastest speed discovered was 60mbps.
it's like the watch from spy kids
it's like when i see posts on here talking about pcs with a thin coating of dust lol ure pc is gonna over heat an die kek kek kek.
it's like you're asking the computer to mansplain to you
it's like you're learning a whole new language, and furthermore, you have to actually write with that language
it's like zoom out, guys, right?
it's like, name an image format that supports lossless raster animation
it's like, sure, technically an amazing digital background is just 1920x1080 (or whatever the resolution hipsters are using these days) sets of choices of 2^32 colors
it's linux anyway.first the government and after the gaymers will be forced to comply.in the end deepin is still a traditional linux os.
it's literal cancer.
it's literally at the same bitrate you moron
it's literally for no reason other than doing everything the exact opposite of apple.
it's literally just a fun way to pass the time.
it's literally just filled with kids posting porn/ylyl threads nowadays
it's literally only one key longer.
it's literally the same exact video, one playing in the browser and one streaming in the media player.
it's literally the same joke over and over.
it's literally training people's brains to expect that hit whenever they demand it, and then also showing them other people getting larger doses of that hit, so they either emulate them, or live vicariously through them
it's literally unfinished product and it will never be finished
it's looks very amateurish and not visually pleasing at all.
it's made by nsa and controlled by nsa, stop being a retard, there is no way they wouldn't control such a tool.>you won't get put on a watchlist simply for using tor - noryou do, you are too smart for them if you use such tools
it's manual shifting vs automatic.for some it works better for others it's a fucking nightmare
it's max cpu and gpu but only 32gb ram and 2x2tb m.2 ssds
it's media that's not under control of the globalists and their silicon valley tools which is why there's such a strong global response to kill it.
it's mirrored to the discord's #general.
it's more complex than that
it's more cyberpunkits the futuretechnology woooha !!!
it's more hassle than it's worth because it's a replacement for pulseaudio, not alsa.
it's more like 50-60 hour weeks for 10 years and then youre in a position to comfortably retire
it's more stable, has a large variety of packages, and runs really well on most devices.
it's mostly new grad/junior hiring that has frozen.
it's much similar to windows in terms of layout and in my experience is a lot more stable.
it's my 4chan images.
it's my daily driver
it's my pc from early 2012and it's great for my workmemory speed is no bottle neck for me
it's named by john mccarthy, the inventor of ai, after list processing
it's nearly everywhere, how can i make sure this extension is not dangerous?
it's nice but some things don't seem to work properly on it, like channel pages
it's nice.
it's no longer in the official repositories, but there could be a package in a third-party overlay.if all else fails, you could make your own
it's no zilog z80
it's not
it's not a complete game, but it has enough content you can sit down and play it for a hundred hours.star citizen is an alpha test of game features, where everything is half broken and the direction changes every few months
it's not a conspiracy or even hidden knowledge
it's not a laptop general, it's just for thinkpads and other business laptops.there's a gaming laptop general too.
it's not a magical cloud.a better description would be running a server written in basic and running in a commodore emulator, but that would be insulting to basic.except you have to pay to get a special number to even use it
it's not a new vendor at all.
it's not a simple yes or no thing given the parameters.
it's not about fairness, it's about winning no matter whatsystemd dominates pid 1 and now it will dominate ring 0
it's not all that sharp.
it's not always well written and the attention given to topics is not always well balanced
it's not amps, it's watts which is voltage x amps.but yes, in principle you can do this but the limitation is cost and size
it's not an application, how can it crash?>>77083123>>77083116i work as a developer and it's not so bad desu
it's not apparent in what colour space the rgb values are getting picked
it's not apples fault that they're the only ones that figured out how marketing works.
it's not archive.org blocking it
it's not at all though and you cant even use the chink app if you arent in chinkland, you glowing chink shilltry to be less obvious
it's not banned
it's not censorship though
it's not clear enough
it's not complete, but i have some of it done
it's not crazy shit
it's not currently possible
it's not designed for that
it's not emulation that's the cause.it's video games, as usual.when's the last time you heard the qemu guys flinging shit at each other?
it's not even bait, retard.indie games written in unity don't make money, it's not 2010 anymore.
it's not even difficult.
it's not even his setup he's simping for because i'm the one who posted it lol
it's not even more precise than a mouse and keyboard you dumb fuck, if you can't compete with those what makes you think it's competing with a steering wheel and pedals?
it's not even that good of an armpit.
it's not fake news
it's not good for right handers either
it's not google, that's enough for me.
it's not hard
it's not hard to learn about urbit, ok?
it's not interesting and the main issue, besides the weird logic, was the fact that the most of the community support happened in google groups.
it's not just the 5g, it also gets a bigger battery, a wide-angle lens and a faster soc (sd765g) over the regular 4a.
it's not known what it is but it could be the rumored co-processor used for ray tracing calculations.
it's not like anybody will be proud or impressed.
it's not like exfat is currently very widely adopted in linuxland anyway, aside from some android phones and maybe some embedded systems.
it's not like it doesn't have a headphone jack either.
it's not like most gaymer pcs have any cables besides the gpu and atx ones.
it's not like there's a technical flaw they can patch
it's not like they generally have any plan on what kind of hardware they need, they just want the best and visibly a new model for bragging rights
it's not like they're ever actually giving up that data anyway once it's in their systems.
it's not like they're threatening him, it's a polite request
it's not like you have to get burn-in
it's not likely, but personally i wouldn't risk it.
it's not linux that's dying, it's that your sysadmin role is becoming obsolete
it's not me i've been framed
it's not mean to protect you from the fbi or anything else, it's sole purpose is to hide your activity from your isp.>>77194445pia isn't really recommended any more and you don't have to pick a server in another country so long as you can port forward.
it's not not porn
it's not possible
it's not pre-puberty, so telling them apart from a petite 18yo could be quite challenging.
it's not programming for one.
it's not really a good thing even for burgers because any likely burger alternative still is full kraken.
it's not really a matter of how much the charger can pump out, though, it's a matter of how fast the battery can accept it
it's not really worth it unless you're really dedicated to the meme.
it's not really worth it, the only places that you'd be able to download with the full speed are torrents and steam, the rest of the internet caps out at about 100mbps.
it's not showing up on nvidias official site that's why i'm asking.
it's not so much about the angle as about the amount of material
it's not software that's the issue, they went for tradeoffs in size/weight
it's not sticking
it's not still?
it's not superior, just comfy.
it's not sustainable though, the chickens are coming home to roost anyway
it's not that bad, it's just really annoying
it's not that good for drawing if you're serious about it
it's not that i don't know about other des, it's just only those 2 actually matter.
it's not that it's going to immediately corrupt your data, it's that it's not much faster than software raid, and you're locked to that mb for the life of the array
it's not them who struggle with simple shell commands...
it's not type-checked, involves horrendous syntax and relies on dynamically-linked function calls, meaning only the bloated compilers that cniles are supposed to hate can ever hope to optimize it.>>78528964memory leak = bad program
it's not very relevant when you're a code monkey using a language with made by really smart people to be used by humans in a high level of abstraction and you can use libraries and apis made of other people
it's not wayland who doesn't support nvidia
it's not wide enough to fit two horizontally rectangular windows side by side, but it's also not tall enough to allow comfortably reading long pages and files.i have a wide 21:9 1440p main monitor and a secondary 16:9 1080p monitor which i keep in portrait mode
it's not you retard
it's not your board, it's hiro's
it's not your usual freetard shit like gimp or libreoffice.
it's nothing
it's nothing but a meme that they created on this board
it's nothing special, huawei is banned from the us because they laughed at american backdoors and how badly written they were
it's nvidia who doesn't support wayland.
it's obvious from the benchmarks that gnu/linux crushes *bsd even in the few limited tasks where they claim to specialize.>the bsd philosophy is do 1 thing and do it poorly.
it's obviously not portable in the first place, so it having to be connected at all times is not an issue.>gaming laptop, marketed as portable
it's obviously the future, it's hard to admit for some of you because you've gone balls deep in pointless bullshit languages or bought into closed ecosystems
it's often seen as intrusive, and difficult to use, but it can also be used to spool and manage the logs of any app you've wrapped up in systemd
it's ok
it's ok though, i'm a zoomer too.
it's okay anon most people are now understanding that tech bros are massive assholes.
it's okay anon, i'm sure no one will judge you for spending too much money on a computer case, one that's inferior to the meshify c
it's on the front though, i've got a laptop.
it's on the goals for neovim 0.5.0.seems pretty nice
it's one of the few disadvantages of open source.that said excel is still a pos and should stick with making budget sheets and nothing more
it's one thing to operate a service for the public, i'd very much like to run an exit node because i believe in the right to anonymity (but i'm not going to because lmaoooo)
it's only 20 years old
it's only a b8 m$ made to lure programmers to use it over java.
it's only cheaper if you choose a shitty jmicron enclosure but what you save in your wallet you pay for in reliability especially over a period of years
it's only javascript
it's only legal if the nsa does it
it's only now becoming what it should have been.
it's only one row of keys larger than a tkl.
it's only telemetry and forced updates.
it's only worth it if you want to have the absolute best, but wanting that is stupid by itself and is just mindless consooming.tl:dr i want to do it because it's fun leave me alone
it's open source, so it's anthony that's going to show it off>now all you have to do is slide it in>pbhhbp
it's outside the divine specifications
it's over /g/ chrome won
it's over, bittorrent is bankrupt and finished!
it's over, elon won.
it's over.
it's paid off
it's painful to look at desu
it's painfully obvious why he's been fired from every job in tech he's ever had.while not totally incompetent, he suffers from massive dunning kruger syndrome
it's part of the open office concept.it's for making telephone calls without disturbing the other wagies.you're not expected to use them for longer than an hour or so, and everyone can use them.
it's past my bedtime and you seemed paranoid about the wrong things, i thought digging deeper could help you realize your problem is not technologically related
it's pathetic seeing itoddlers on /g/ trying to shittalk other oses or argue this outdated bsd ripoff is even relevant.
it's peaceful here.
it's perfect
it's perfectly fine, unless you're doing something extreme like stock trading or building medical devices
it's physical
it's physically impossible for ethanol to taste good to healthy, normal human tastebuds
it's practically the same as reading a book, watching tv or any other indoors activity
it's precisely because it takes up so much of my life that i've learned to resent its flaws
it's pretty adjustable
it's pretty common to have similar flaws with everything they develop for free, c'mon!
it's pretty cool desu.
it's pretty easy now
it's pretty excellent, particularly if you already have programming knowledge, it really reinforces some concepts that may have been vague.
it's pretty good
it's pretty good but no longer makes much sense.if you care about muh safe c++ you have rust, and c++ itself has gotten better.otherwisec# basically fills the same role and is much more stable and mature.
it's pretty hard to go wrong buying a monitor
it's pretty nice actually and i picked it over react to avoid cancerous bloggerdevs and twitterdevs
it's pretty obvious 'a disciple of programming' goes well above your mental capacity.
it's pretty obvious op doesn't have any programming knowledge, the book is very helpful.
it's pretty quick with webrender enabled
it's pretty sensitive to poor font rendering, not just on the kerning side but overall, you either get fonts that are too sharp or too blurry, no inbetween
it's pretty simpleyou'd want to use a rss client first, if you are on linux, i would recommend newsboat if you like terminal applications, or liferea if you like gui.if you're on windows, i'd use rssowlnix or quiterss.anyways, do your own research and use your favorite
it's probably not the most interesting thing, but i imagine how this would improve emulation, since, well you can emulate anything, just by simulating the hardware – if you have enough power
it's probably part of the deal the nfl + tv guys argued for, they don't want free official streams to cannibalize their viewership.
it's probably right
it's probably the fact that she is into programming that makes her more attractive than she is
it's probably trivial to setup a website in a vm though, right?
it's probably worth at least looking at the textbook, there's some great knowledge there too (lots of useless stuff like ethernet standards but whatever)
it's promising, but try compiling it on a shit machine, it compiles skia and other c++ libraries that take ages to compile, besides that it's quite promising
it's pulling it in from outside the case
it's quite simple, realy..
it's quite well documented at https://ebruneton.github.io/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/ , just need to find more time outside of the day job to work on it.
it's rainmeter, if that's what you're talking about.>>77090186lol
it's rather comfy.however, interfacing it to python is quite a hassle
it's really as simple as having money.is a 250 dollar keyboard 10 times better than 25 one?
it's really just great - and open source.
it's really not hard going from rust to c++
it's really pissing me off
it's really the worst cooling design in a laptop today

it's shit compared to clangd anyway.
it's shit for watching videos, which is a lowly dopamine addiction i have kicked, and not that great for gaming, which i don't give a damn about.
it's shit.
it's simple and straight forward.
it's simple supply and demand.it's not simple
it's simply not for home use.
it's simply the best way to shave.
it's sitting there, unexploited, filled with riches and resources that can be leveraged internally or externally.
it's slower than pygame friend, slower than a butchered javascript game
it's smarter to just exclude the drive than to cancel indexing
it's so complicated.
it's so difficult to move to a better standard when an existing one just werkslook at the clusterfuck that was metric system adoption attempts in the us
it's so fucking terrible.
it's so shit, people are still sitting on xpm$ haven't created anything of benefit for > 25 years
it's so simple that it is difficult, for me at least, to see any problems with it>humans evolved and adapted to one type of environment / society>technological progress has changed our society / environment into a new one, radically different to the one in which we evolved>humans are ill adapted to this new environment/society
it's so useful
it's sobering that this is legitimately the policy that might sway the election

it's sql studio, i'll pay $100 cash or $200 in csgo skins.truth be told i just don't care about programming or scripting and i'm just in college because it's required for my position at work, i just don't want to retake the class again
it's still a beautiful piece though.
it's still a meme that only informs sites you wouldn't like to be tracked
it's still a record of development history since you can still go through the commits one by one and see what they changed, in order
it's still android, so everything should work just fine.i've been using custom roms (bootleggers and havocos now) for the last 2-3 years and i've never had any problems with those apps.
it's still not a clear win over mozjpeg
it's still one trivial command on a linux shell for each file in folder, run ffmpeg to output compressed av1 to other folder or in some gui ffmpeg batching tool, you don't need to babysit it yourself).for audio you can either capture the same way or just do lossy ~160bit opus/aac from the start since it'll either way basically completely capture what vhs audio was able to represent
it's still through a screen so it's ok
it's still too annoying
it's stillborn.
it's sucks with an old thinkpad with only 8gb of memory, the best now for me is to just use clear linux.
it's supposedly very light weight
it's supreme chinkshit.
it's surprisingly cheap for the specs

its so fucking ugly
its susceptible to things like eclipse attacks and suffers from a bunch of other drawbacks like once you implement something into the protocol you cant remove it without making a hard fork (which is essentially an entirely different crypto) you can see many examples of this in the actual bitcoin network protocol where they use insufficient datatypes which they cant change anymore & several hacks for compatibility with older clients

it’s a great experience to interact with people who have been working in this field for over the years.
it’s a shame as it could be a complement to freedos.
it’s a universally symbolic idea
it’s an old school ipad that was reported missing and paid for some time ago
it’s around $100 new.
it’s backed by the mineslaves of chinese and american citizens.
it’s become increasingly clear that his views and ideas are at odds with those of the other developers and many of mpv’s users, so i guess he just fucked off for good because he got fed up with making compromise after compromise for people who didn’t agree with the way he’d been running the project.to begin with, mpv turned into its own project in part because i was putting a lot of effort into backporting his changes for my windows builds of mplayer2, which are what made the player somewhat popular among weeaboos (i was also working on smplayer2 at the time and spent some time getting feedback on /g/)
it’s cathartic to you to be such an asshole we get it
it’s china though, you’d be set for comfortable life with that money there
it’s crazy simple on both of those
it’s definitely a step up in both risk and convenience - with that risk comes responsibility (keep things updated, watch logs on occasion, etc).
it’s easier
it’s everything i own
it’s got “absolute software” protection on it, and i have no idea how to remove this
it’s like c++ with rounded corners
it’s literally just conditional statements with weighted results rather than absolute results
it’s more convenient than openvpn/wireguard for me, but the exposed ports scares me
it’s my first time looking tech advice here, i lurk on other boards
it’s never going to become stable, let alone mature
it’s nice have a /comfy/ home for all your data
it’s nice to have a /comfy/ home for all your data
it’s not your fault
it’s not, the compiler is smart enough to fix that but if you look at how is game runs he clearly still did an awful job.
it’s only purpose is to keep the metal bar from rattling inside the plastic hole.the film can stick out, and it won’t make too much of a difference to sound, but it can be annoying later on if you use a hotswap board because you can tear the film when removing the switch.
it’s only the mac address that can uncover you.
it’s pretty comfy coming from other c langs
it’s stable, lightweight, and most importantly, it works.
it’s tech companies, they hate paying people who are skilled in programming so the idea is to replace them with more, and cheaper, “coders.”are you a retard?
it’s the reason he effectively forked mplayer2 (or rather stopped trying to get changes past uau) in the first place, and probably also the reason for the aforementioned episode with haasn, or that other time he just saw himself out to work on a personal fork instead
it’s time to let it die.meanwhile x.org is finished software, needing only the occasional driver merge

ive discovered a mesh network that spans the majority of ontario, most of which using bell fibe internet
ive done some research and suspect that this is because its an older server, x9dr3 motherboard, and that back then manufacturers just signed their own ipmi signatures
ive got 30mbps internet
ive got a similar issue, have a founders gtx1080 in a nzxt midi itx case thats only 2 slot and i have a radiatior in the front which i was potentially going to swap out for a noctua n15s heatsink to give me some more room, could also potentially remove the radiator/fan bracket from the front and gain another inch or so.i'm gonna have to measure, waiting on seeing the dimensions on these founders cards then looking at what evga/gigabyte/msi etc are putting out in 2 slot to see if they fit, would like to avoid buying another case and psu (750w) if i can, but willing too if i need too.
ive got a thrustmaster tmx and its pretty baller not gonna lie
ive had programming classes in my college but i never really got it, can i just learn the syntax and put certain syntax phrases into a compiler and its gonna do what it needs to do?
ive heard custom builds are the way to go but im not entirely sure
ive never bought an external hard drive because i was a stream fag but now ive begun to download stuff and its taking a lot of space, my internal hdd has like 50gb left
ive never done this so you might want to not follow my advice.
ive never owned an iem so i cant comment on that
ive noticed most /csg/ posters are trannies
ive tried every distro there is, from ubuntu to mageia to fedora to slackware and gentooslaxopensuse tumbleweed and leapdebian, devuanarchfuntooyou fuckin name it
ive tried with some freeware photogrammetry software

java ee classes and javafx getting removed from the jdk.otherwise it wouldn't be a big deal to only use features of an older version of the language and yet take advantage of performance improvements in the current version of the jvm.
java is either the 1st or 2nd most common language today so you already do know something of value.
java is halfway between the two and just sucks.
java uses different types so performing the wrong operation would be a compile-time error (no such method); and for a serversocket, the listen() call is performed automatically.
java, elixir, clojure, c# and even [spoiler]php[/spoiler] are better choice than any javascript meme derivative for backend development.kys

kinda glad i live in my comfy shithole of a countrywhen money is involved people actually try to get the best they can for their money so we don't buy macbooks and iphones like americans only rich people and politicians buy applealso i've never seen a legitimate copy of windows on a pcon laptops sure, they one they came with but everyone who had windows installed has a pirated version so microsoft only gets money from companies who have to buy legitimate software or they get raided but all companies still buy stolen keys online for few cents $ because they only have to have a invoice that they bought the key and they can claim they didn't know they keys were stolen
kinda hefty for a smartphone though, but that's what you get with an aluminum body.

lambda is only for short functions, if you have something that is multi-line and with logic structures, it is better to use def.
lambdas are cool and shit but is rarely used because it fucks your readability and maintainability

language-specific skills are not what makes you valuable as an employee (or a programmer in general).if only someone told the employers...
languages don't matter, focus on your fundamentals (application design/data structures and algorithms/operating systems), if anything consider learning python because it's less verbose and you'll spend less time writing boilerplate code and can grind more leetcode
languages should be designed to be usable without an ide

laptops are ok, but don't go any higher since you'll start burning money

linus is relatively charismatic/affable for a tech person
linus is the colonel
linus seems pretty okay with the idea of kernel rust so far.
linux
linux actually doesn't run well if at all on most arm devices like it can on windows
linux allows you to do a lot of shit windows doesnt but whenever some toddler breaks their ubuntu its the linux's fault not theirs that they chmodded their root folder to 000
linux apparently does happen to be a whole operating system unto itself and comprises a full os as defined by posix.most computer users who run the entire linux operating system every day already realize it
linux can mount an smtp connection, run adb, etc, anything else you could possibly want to do on your phone from your pc.>10
linux can mount smtp, that's all the integration you need and all the integration you ever use on any other device.

linux doesn't care about this but windows does.
linux doesn't get malware because no one makes malware for lin-
linux doesn't have this problem.
linux exposes all of that in intentionally scriptable ways
linux got people's and later also corporations support.
linux has them
linux is a bootloader for chrome and emacs anyways
linux is a hybrid kernel
linux is a joke on desktop
linux is a kernel
linux is a kernel.
linux is already made for those as well
linux is also a colloquialism for operating systems that use the aforementioned kernel
linux is as free as your time spent configuring it..
linux is bloat
linux is far too bloated now for 68k
linux is finished.
linux is for hyperautists
linux is free if your time is worthless.
linux is its flagship kernel.users of all levels are welcome to ask questions about gnu and share their experiences.before asking for help, please check our list of resources and faq or take a moment to do a web search.*** please be civil, notice the friendly in every friendly gnu thread ***if you would like to try out gnu, you can do one of the following:>install a gnu distribution of your choice in a virtual machine>boot into a gnu distribution from a live image without installing anything>dual boot the gnu distribution of your choice along with windows or macosif you'd like to _use_ gnu, go balls deep and replace everything with gnu.general was renamed because the os is gnu, linux is just one of its components, but this is still the right place to discuss linux, the kernel, if you so wish.resources:$ man <command>$ info <command>$ <command> -h/--help$ help <builtin>don't know what to look for?$ apropos <something>check the wikis:https://wiki.archlinux.orghttps://wiki.gentoo.org/g/'s wiki on gnu:https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/category:gnu/linux/fgt/'s collaborative copypasta collection:https://pad.disroot.org/p/fgtfaq:>what distro should i choose?https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/babbies_first_linux>what are some cool programs?https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applicationshttps://directory.fsf.org/wiki/main_page>what are some cool terminal commands?http://www.commandlinefu.comhttp://cheat.sh>where can i learn the command line?http://mywiki.wooledge.org/bashguidehttp://www.grymoire.com/unixhttp://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit>where can i learn more about free software?https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.htmlhttp://moglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/maine-speech.htmlhttp://moglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/dcm.htmlprevious thread: >>77315739
linux is just a kernal
linux is never used in combination with gnu accessories: the whole system is basically linux without any gnu added, or just linux
linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system: the whole system is basically gnu with linux added, or gnu/linux
linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix.many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day, without realizing it
linux is not unix though
linux is now my bottom bitch as a macos app
linux is now my bottom bitch in wsl
linux is only free if you don't value your timethis can be extended to free software in general is only free if you don't value your time
linux is only free if your time is worthless.
linux is perfectly capable of gui, in fact it is the most popular gui capable os in the world right now.
linux is profitable for people who value their time and spend it wisely, such as red hat.
linux is repository slavery
linux is sa kernel.
linux is superior in every way.
linux is the kernel.
linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run
linux is the kernel: the program in the systemthat allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.the kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself;it can only function in the context of a complete operating system
linux is the operating system: the entire system made useful by its included corelibs, shell utilities, and other vital system components
linux is unironically dead yet the developers will persevere just so aws / azure / google can run cheap servers
linux is way too unreliable and the vicious break/fix cycle make me think my time is more valuable that this
linux isnormally used in combination with the gnu operating system: the whole systemis basically gnu with linux added, or gnu/linux
linux mint moved chromium from snap to apt>lefebvre wrote, the chromium browser is now available in the official repositories for both linux mint and lmde
linux mint truly is one of the best distros
linux mint with steam.installing the nvidia drivers is a game itself.
linux reigned supreme and now it's the most popular os in the world.
linux should be all about choice, no?
linux started gaining steam, which meant gnu had no need for hurd except as one of those 'research projects' (aka useless shit)if you actually want to see the future for microkernels, see fuchsia, harmony, and genode/sel4.
linux started out as a project to tell microsoft and corporate america to fuck off
linux still can't get fonts working good out of the box in 2020
linux user here, i am downloading videos to watch them because i don't want to wait for all the buffering but also i quickly discard them after watching

lisp because she is an advanced ai programmed by a complete psychopath.
lisp is simple enough to understand immediately if you know other languages, and i have experience to tie their examples to things that i normally encounter in my own applications, so it was useful even without the book in my experience.probably more necessary for beginners, but comes with a mathematical prereq for understanding the examples and why/where you'd use the concepts they're teaching you, more generally than just straightforward algebra problem solving.

mac and linux users will never know the joys of backwards compatibility.
mac is only free if your time is worthless.oh, it isn't.
mac lost and is 7% down from 9% and linux just broke 5% market share
mac minis for like 5-6 years didn't get a refreshthey stayed quite outdated compared to their laptop contemporaries
mac os will still be supported on intel macs for atleast the next 6 years but keep coping
mac os* gui is basically javascript* toolbox rom draws menus at runtime in a single frame* files have a four character type code and a four character creator code, so you can assign files of the same type to different programs* resource fork guisadly mac os was thrown away and we got stuck with some horrible trash with a buggy terminal
mac users
mac-os is a linux kde desktop environment
macbook prices for a desktop replacement to work my remote job if the civil war kicks off.
macbooks are meh-tier but i wouldn't want to spend 1k on laptop specs that are near sub-500 pricethinkpads are super based, though i want something in the gaming range as i personally use my laptop as my desktop
machine learning, this shit will be hot in some years and no one in my country knows shit about except some meme shit deep fake
macos
macos also has some type of usage case, i mean, that is in the case your 8-year old needs some form of computer.
macos can't run shit and neither can linux.
macos does this.
macos has its own hypervisor called hvf but only qemu, vmware, and an abandoned virtualmachine app called veertu have used it.perhaps, if you don't care about pretty ui and other niceties (sound may sound somewhat worse etc.) you can install linux.
macos is a gnome theme.
macos is a linux theme.
macos is built on top of darwin and is posix complaint, and contains a bsd subsystem.>>77096107no, we know exactly what it is, retard
macos is just a theme for xfce.
macos is open source?https://opensource.apple.com/did richard stallman lie to me?
macos is the final redpill.if you want a professional unix environment that just works, you need macos.nobody in the real world gives a shit about your riced loonix de
macos is worthless, considering how much it costs.
macos is worthless, when the next update renders your worthless hardware worthless.
macos isn't a walled garden though
macos runs on kvm since forever.>reminder that instigating or participating in flame/brand wars will result in a ban.when are mods going to enforce this?
macos uses authorizationframework
macs are a fucking joke
macs are far more secure than wangblows machines
macs didn't even had colors?
macs have the best screens on a laptop and macos > windows
macs heat up like crazy even with simple casual games

made a dashboard for a company for some specific stuff they had, after they saw the potential of an online dashboard they hired 3 devs to help me and automate 90% of the shit they do, rendering excel obsolete for the most part, i even made it so that they can export the data from the site to excel by one button to have backup folders so yes, one dev can render excel completely obsolete
made a few basic projects then moved on to react.once you spend some time with a framework with react, making large scale apps becomes a lot easier, especially if you have some back end experience

manjaro
manjaro ain't minimalist/ it's arch with a ton of extra shiteif that's what you want just do arch by itself without the handholding
manjaro feels like a weird middle ground no one really needs.as for gaming, it's easy if the game you want to play works natively on gnu/linux (freeciv, openrtc, ...)
manjaro is for new users, they don't know that you can download a pre-built image, they don't really even know what is a image..
manjaro is just bad and poorly maintained
manjaro kde is perfect linux desktop experience, never had any problems with it.
manjaro tries to make this more accessible to normies giving you things like an installer, a gui by default, aur helpers etc.if you want an easy distro for a beginner try ubuntu/popos/mint, fedora, opensuse, mageia, ..
manjaro was breaking itself too often for my taste, but artix was pretty hassle free and stable.the few problems one will face are related to the arch repos being a little faster than the artix ones

nice, and i have heard of this, but obviously none of that applies to op, it's not a user-servicable part, that is, op can't replace it, he doesn't have the tools or the skills, not to mention calibrating a crt from scratch is no walk in the park, either, if is if was just something you could swap outi'm no way near your level, someone who actually worked on them professionally, but i've read a lot about some of the finer detailsi find it fascinating how well they do work, considering how much needs to be just right for it to work

no crossplatform support - safari can directly use the system's apis to do its rendering, while other browsers use some abstraction layer so they don't have to reimplement everything for every os they port to.apple also added various private apis to their operating systems that exist solely to be used by safari, to be able to render as fast as possible.kinda based, but also kinda anticompetitive, but on ios, there is no other browser engine anyway, so it doesn't even matter too much

no where did he say that pedophilia is a good thing, or that people should become pedophiles.the fact that stallman is willing to publicly question something like this, despite the enormous social pressure to silently agree with the majority opinion, makes him more qualified to be the president of fsf than anyone else.

oh actually yeah this カ is katakana, but that に is hiragana
oh also, your going to need to read a book a c++ software engineering book in order to properly organize your project and the project tree in a way that isn't retarded.

oh great, we have a second paid anti bsd thread going!
oh i already have a 165hz monitor, and to be honest i can't really tell the difference past 140ish hz.i have tried 240hz monitors but without having a 144hz one side to side to compare i can't say it's noticeably better.i think anything past 144 is meme terroitory.but 60hz is unacceptable, 100hz minimum imo.

oh yeah you don't have to imagine it because that's the reality
oh yeah, and remember that the man command and google are your friends, just try to understand what causes any errors you encounter when you go looking for a fix for them, that way you'll know on a fundamental level what's causing you issues and wont have to completely rely on the internet to fix any problems you might have
oh yeah, if you had that then the php error wouldn't show

okay, but that applies to the web in general.
okay, but that does not answer the question
okay, even if it can be voluntary, i think it is still harmful - the adult always has advantage over children which leads to abuse.anyway, stallman should think more before saying something.he likely made many people who were abused in the past uncomfortable at least, he scared normal people having children.i think it really is undermining free software and gnu project.being autistic isn't an excuse - a good leader needs to know what people want to hear and bears the responsibility.stallman carelessly posted pedo stuff on his blog and did weird shit.the free software movement was too centralized around rms and the situation with guix shows this well.he could prevent it by democratizing gnu earlier, but he didn't.
okay, i am uninstalling this stupid browser
okay, i hate the freetard community.i love when i discover that i **can** make some windows exclusive game run on linux, and that it's as simple as clicking on a lutris installer.i love when developers do a linux native, and when it works.i love that there is so many distros, and that each of them is focused on doing something in the best possible way.i love the feeling when i get an update
okay, i wanna get rid of my phone.how do i substitute my 2fa app?
okay, i'll be sure to do that thing that benefits me in no way.mpv contempt.jpg laughing_whores.webm --loop-playlist
okay, this is getting ridiculous
okay.

ombi is literally meant to be a dumbed-down normie-friendly frontend to *arrs, what exactly do you find non-comfy about it?
omegle
omg /g/ btfoscience just confirmed what we knew all along!!
omg based xd
omg clojure is so wholesome like keanu reeves!!1!
omg you actually used loony linux?
omg, get windows 10 like the rest of us, i use windows for my whole life and it is much better than linux for the common user
omni fucked over buyers by taking chink investor money and switching to a vr arcade subscription based model, so basically nothing properly supports it and the two projects to use it in other games also suck balls
on /g/ ?!?!!???
on 1080p, the usual scaling done by windows at 100% (or 1x) makes fonts look sharp, but you can tell the pixels apart from a fair distance unless you're using a smaller display (22'' or lower)
on a budget?
on a cpu with microcode, the microcode is the software that actually interprets the machine code.

on a similar note, how long should it take to complete the odin project?
on an amstrad desktop with two floppy drives.
on an even larger screen it's probably even nicer
on crux here, by a chance i dont use grub, i use the efi stub since a year ago, why arent more people doing that?
on eloston's own github it's stated that the binaries made available are contributed by literally anyone willing to upload them, so there's absolutely no real control over them
on gnu, v60 was posted last year
on ipad pros it's importantthey have 12,9 inchest screen.
on it's own it's useless to know
on linux libc6 >(version no later) bs gets in the way
on linux my fan constantly bursts even at level 0
on linux you can just check it in your window manager and let it kill the window
on mac os i just use a program called find any file to search non system drives
on macos, where safari is unusable by non-normies due to the lack of web extensions (though that might change with big sur), it also sucks because you have to use a different browser.
on manjaro, you have to learn a few more things, but pacman and yay only take around fifteen minutes to learn.
on my chromebook, i made a 5gb root partition, with all my devtools and my minimalist window manager, i haven't gone over 3gb, i also made a 4gb swap partition, which is probably a waste, i've never seen it used.
on my firefox i'm using the following add-ons:-ublock origin-canvasblocker-decentraleyesalso i've put user.js inside my profile and i'm using the browser with strict privacy, no cockies and no cronology./g/ what is your setup?
on my main computer, i have ltsb, on my other one, i have ltsc, and vs works on both.
on my pc for 16 hours a day for years
on my system i have mu4e installed from the debian repositories so i make sure to not let straight install it again (:straight nil) and make sure its in load-path (:load-path /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e).
on one hand, it's pretty good but on the other hand it could be even cheaper once the new cards are upshould i bite?

on pc you can pirate, on consoles you cannot, which makes consoles completely useless.
on the chimichanga i would like a side of sour cream
on the downside...russiabut on the upside, it's probably cheap
on the intel side of things they require new silicon entirely
on the other end its dc, thats what the box does
on the other hand tho i really like a good camera and i’m not sure if the surface duo has that.
on the other hand, many features you would want to introduce to a beginner (e.g
on the side i networked with a bunch of algo traders, got 2-3 type of neural networks models that could help a hft market making strategy code that i wrote that i gotta mix up together
on the upside, linux makes you appreciate the little things you never thought about
on top of these you need to be a good problem solver, believe in the mission of reactos, and most importantly, be able to demonstrate that you can work with the reactos codebase via a few pull requests.>if you qualify for this position, you’ll be joining the very small and exclusive ranks of people who know how to do nt systems development

once again the new generation's -70 card is equal to the last's -80 ti
once again, macfags are willing to trade security for brain-dead simp-licity.
once again, read your own quote carefully
once i get a request with the value of the app i’ll pay it
once i get their numbers since i've added custom roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern i require all of my friends to download a free and open source messaging app and i share with them my public pgp key so that we can verify our conversations are secure
once i have the money though i am planning a novec pc
once it breaks or apple gimps it to the point that i cant do texts or phone calls on it then i’ll probably buy a cheap chink phone.
once it detects it, it stops printing.>printing the moneyi'm not interested in counterfeiting
once it's on internet, it's here forever.that's not exactly true.
once my dead body is no longer of any use to me, it may as well be of some use to someone.guys i know what i'm going to do today.
once rooms-as-sticker-packs are implemented, you'll have basically the same thing as discord custom emoji.
once that's done, another script removes the snapshot, and the last one unmounts the backup drive to complete the cycle
once the 77inch is up, no not at all
once the feds who run this place require email, it will die.
once the pandemic rolls over and the true system collapse happens, the people that piece through the ashes will have to be hard
once they have 99.9999% of ressources left on this planet and everyone is fucking dying they better be on musk space station or on mars or they won't live long
once they started adding tax on second-hand items i jumped ship.
once upon it had one: rpm
once windows becomes unusable by 2027, it'll become the new standard os
once you get them set you have to glue them (hot glue works good) or use some sort of double-sided tape.adjusting the basic convergence, at least on a triple-gun rgb crt, isn't so bad either, but you do need a crosshatch generator of some sort
once you get used to gnu+linux you should just go as upstream as much as you can
once you graduate from your hobby phase you start realising what it means.
once you have done that go to your gp and get him to prescribe hrt
once you have whateverbuntu running you can play with other distros in virtual machines
once you hear that kind of a statement prepare to be ass fucked because the priority is now time.
once you know the pixel coordinates of the boundaries you'd like to cut on, do a nested for loop shell script.
once you start using a tiling wm and doing most things in the terminal, you realize how much easier it is in every way.>2
once you understand how everything works, you can get something simpler and remove the garbage yourself.

one example are news websites, which should look like drudge report not cnn since they are effectively static pages.bloated web forces people to upgrade their computers and phones
one extremely strange thing i find is that audiophiles are obsessed with barely even measurable em interference levels and whatnot but for some reason completely ignore temperature and humidity levels having an actually measurable impact on most audio gear.i would guess getting yourself a proper climate controlled room would be cheaper than some of the stupid shit i've seen them buy.

one of the hardest things for me to understand new tech is not the tech itself but the proposal seens very much nothing different that we already do on the every day job.for me microservices is nothing more than just expand the classic single-responsibility principle from oop plane to service plane.which makes sense comparing to classic monolithic or semi-monolithic service approach.but we've been doing so already for many years, maybe we just didn't give a hipster name if i am wrong, please enlighten me

os = open source
os extended journaled failed...
os i believe was 3 years, anyway i have a duet as well and i'm waiting on lenovo to releases their own usi stylus.
os is only the best for gaming insofar as it comes with drivers preinstalled.if you install the correct drivers on any other distro they're effectively the same.i'm a newfriend myself and personally i can't stand pop os but i'm super happy with mint
os9 is still my favorite era.
osm main contributors aren't corps so a strong license would be good
osrs bots are good

other distros sucks.
other friend actually asked me and i got him the best psu on the market because you can reuse that shit for multiple builds, has 10 year warranty, and is the most important part of the pc
other languages can encode laziness just fine, it's just opt-in, the c# linq system supports laziness (and is built on monads) for example, and any lisp book has an implementation of lazy combinators in it
other people will judge you.
other side just in case.
other socs are anti-freedom and can't be used.

other than that how is the job market?
other than that its fine.

otherwise a solid controller.
otherwise any spammer could sue any services for deleting the spam.
otherwise i'd install linux (i use both as useful to me and have no ideology except my own convenience) for security.true computer security is never needing security
otherwise i'm 100% sure there's nothing wrong with my pc
otherwise it seems trivial for someone to get a decent place and give it a shot.
otherwise it won't.
otherwise it wouldn't be news.
otherwise it's a fine chair.
otherwise just get into networking as a job and do cybersec as a hobby.
otherwise replace the bottom screen.
otherwise the g203 is a great mouse
otherwise they tend to be marginal at best in benefits.
otherwise you risk damaging anything/everything.
otherwise, /g/ is wrong about it just like /g/ is wrong about everything else
otherwise, a device with 3 cameras looks thick using a built-in phone.samsung still does not have a clear explanation for the hardware characteristics of the new galaxy z fold 2 folding phone, but the galaxy s20 ultra has camera performance and high equipment that we see on flagship ships

otherwise, this webpage for example we're one does a good job of not being bloated, don't ya' think?

outside of the insiders iso they release when it's close to being stable, there's not much you can do about that without opting into telemetry it always demands full feedback.when people report bugs from beta os versions i always just ignore that until it's actually out unless i literally have no other issues to deal with

overclocking past the rated levels is most definitely mistreatment
overclocking ryzens is a bad idea for longevity while offering a minimal performance increase
overclocking your ram on a ryzen system while keeping the cpu stock gives a much larger performance boost while keeping longevity good.

pc displays also have much higher quality control electronics.then only reason to use consoles is for exclusive titles, and even then you want to use a pc screen due to typical display latencies with televisions.
pc that would be running it only has 4gb ram

people already change so much over the course of their lives that one could easily argue that the person you are now is entirely different from who you used to be.
people already do
people always say that it's scummy but i think it's the best way to reach potential customers.
people are anonomous to each other because of fear yet the three letter agencies now each by name and compile all the views and thoughts you share on 4chan.
people are not looking for inconvenience, that's why the majority own phones
people are retarded consoomers and they use their phones to show off their (fake) social statuses.
people are still running air coolers from 20 years ago.
people aren't as unique as they like to think they are
people aren't fools
people def share configs here but it's just not the same, there is a lot more to offer over there if you are actually trying to get better at ricing and using linux, this is more like a gallery or inspo thread
people don't use crypto really and probably never will because it offers nothing they care about
people found in violation of the chrome law will be sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor on the prison colony on the moon.
people grossly overestimate how much development time is spent on 2d engines, the fact is creating actual assets and content will take 90% of the time (as long as you aren’t trying to create a new genre with cutting edge rendering and optimization)
people have actual work to do
people have been saying that this shit is closing since at least 2015.is it?
people here don't get even small programming jobs if they didn't go to a prestigious uni for 4 or 5 years.

people meme on c++ compilers being obtuse, the shit this compiler throws at you might as well be written in sumerian for all the help it is in telling you what the actual fucking problem is
people need to avoid suse at all costs.
people often incorrectly think calculus when they hear that math is important in cs, but what is actually important is discrete mathematics.
people only care about aesthetics and with the firefox gnome theme around, that's already sorted.i've been using gnome web for about two weeks now for unrelated reasons
people really don't like looking at many files, always focus on the problem in your code, and simplify it, don't distract people who are reading your code, you should be smart enough to know what you do not know.if you want someone to perform code review of your whole code, you would use a website and look at how others posted their code (but your code is quite ugly and people would attack your stupid c style approach so code review is pointless).you can use pastebin if you really must, but people helping you are most likely are using something called a web compiler eg: godbolt, onlinegdb, etc
people stalked him and apparently he really worked for google
people still use non-managed languages like c++
people themselves decide what they develop and what they use.

phone privacy is a big meme, but application security (and anonymity via afwall routing apps to orbot) for android works great.
phone, wallet, keys.everything else goes in my backpack.
phone?
phones are built solely to make calls.
phones are way too personal to buy second hand.most people use it in the pocket for the entire day.
phones don't really live that long to make it worth repairing them, especially if they're already three years old and lg quality.
phones have nand cells for the disk memory, which means the data is written across the cells in parallels, kind of like a raid setup
phones now are similar in size to old phones, but with much smaller bezels
phones stack images to achieve higher dynamic range, when you have the camera app open it's constantly taking photos and storing them in the buffer and when you press the shutter, it takes the last few of them and stacks them together
phones went from buttons everywhere to a featureless slab of glass

pressed kinda hard at first, noticed it a bit more when i started wearing glasses hence the need for comfort this time.major stores are having big sales on headphones due to covid, thought i could take the oportunity to invest on something nicer than the earbuds i've been using.
pressure itself is worthless, pressure vs
pressurised air tools work on the principle of turning a pressure differential into mechanical energy.if you create a closed loop, that would involve increasing the pressure on the back end, thereby decreasing the pressure differential, thereby reducing the useful energy extracted from a particular volume of air at a particular pressure.most air compressors are 2-stage compression cycles, the second stage being far less efficient than the first

probably a 9pro or even a poco f1 but i'd prefer not to get a xiaomeme, go for something better within the range of 300-400$
probably a bit of a weird question but i'd massively appreciate some help from someone experienced.i installed slackware 3.1 on an old toshiba t2100ct
probably a shitton of small ones
probably because they installed a backdoor.
probably better than the first generation phenom's.

probably but i'd rather be pozzee by a rando vs jewgle, betasos or zuckbook
probably dns shit
probably feeding the 2 leakers false info or just tighter on the info leakage about 3080ti
probably fucked up on some databases, i'm going to blame it on one of the junior programmer

purism is sending out theirs legally as development devices because that's the only way they can be sold without fcc certification, pine64 went ahead and got fcc certification so the current pinephones are technically consumer products that have some marketing material aimed at developers (like the rest of what they sell).

right now i'm mostly just playing with a behavioral model i wrote in c++.i did an implementation for in logisim a while back, but my design was much simpler then.once i figure out how i should lay out the privilege levels, i'm looking to write the design up in archc (http://www.archc.org/), since it claims to be able to automatically produce a llvm backend for your isa.eventually i will probably implement it on a fpga
right now i'm really just pushing characters to a string, but in the future i'm going to make it so that allocation will only be necessary for unusually formed numbers (ones containing underscores, for instance).anyway, the result of that work is this (number is number(numberrepr, f64)): .123: number(decimal, 0.123) 123: number(decimalinteger, 123.0) 1_2_3: number(decimalinteger, 123.0) 1_2.3_4: number(decimal, 12.34) 12e3: number(decimalinteger, 12000.0) 1.2e3: number(decimalinteger, 1200.0) 1e+3: number(decimalinteger, 1000.0) 1e-3: number(decimal, 0.001) 1.23: number(decimal, 1.23) 0xff: number(hexadecimal, 255.0) 0xabe1: number(hexadecimal, 44001.0) 0b011011: number(binary, 27.0) 0o7125: number(octal, 3669.0)

rust
rust actually makes sense if you look at it in the context that you want other people to write the code and you want to make sure their code isn't going to introduce bugs and side effects
rust and clojure are all the way up on my list of languages to learn
rust doesn't support varargs so it has to be done in a macro.
rust if you want sanity.
rust is comfy but will totally not make it to mainstream since most devs are plain retards
rust is more enjoyable than go
rust is not any higher level than c++ is.
rust is often said to be the most trans programming language
rust is statically linked by default
rust is the real trannie language.
rust will never reach tried and tested for 50 years if no one tries it in the first place.
rust's binaries are generally somewhere between slightly smaller than c binaries to maybe twice their size, assuming equivalent compiler settings
rust's memory safety is a lie as their ecosystem is full of unsafe calls
rust, and other languages that claim to kill/replace c++, have been born dead.>let me explain: in computing, it is impossible and totally unacceptable to make a clean slate!

so clearly suckless devs are fine with that.>yes, it is more idealistic than pragmatic>their philosophy is validthey correctly identified the problem of software getting continuously slower but their solutions are terrible.this is from their website:>code complexity is the mother of bloated, hard to use, and totally inconsistent software>with complex code, problems are solved in suboptimal ways, valuable resources are endlessly tied up, performance slows to a haltquicksort is more complex than selection sort.multithreading adds complexity.offloading work to gpu via opencl or cuda adds a lot of complexity.custom allocators add complexity.>hackers are proud of large amounts of code [...] they think of themselves as masterminds, understanding what others can never hope to grasp.>as the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.they are just proud to be wrong.
so do i have to use arch?

so for the past year i used streamlink a lot because they had the --hls-live-restart feature which allowed you to record any livestream from the moment it started (even if it was a 2+ hours livestream).i checked their github and found some people talking about the problem here: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/2936it seems like youtube changed the way rewind works on livestreams so streamlink doesn't support record from start feature when it comes to youtube...so i wanted to know if anyone here figured a workaround for this problem.as far as i'm concerned youtube-dl didn't allow me to do this in the past, which was the reason i started using streamlink for live recording.

so i could possibly just run windows 10 on my ssd keeping it as a d:/ disk
so i did some research and found that openvpn can be set to run through port 443, but i have yet to find a guide on doing it in the terminal (most are serverside guides), and reading the --help menu on openvpn helps, but it needs me to set up a tun/tap device, and at this point i am stumped
so i figured i would go use my local library

so i've had 4 kindles starting from a dx and one sony e-reader, and read about an hour every dayhonestly at this point lcd's are so good and can lower brightness so effectively that i've ended up returning to them

so if i were to take a strong neodymium magnet and place it in just the right spot,the lock will open
so if i'm reading this right, apple decides what programs you can have on your computer and not you?
so if that is what you want you can use openbsd no problem
so if the hardware benchmarks they’ve shoved hold true that they can beat nvidia in raw performance, and if they can squash nvidia’s ”mindshare” trends/gimmicks (because nvidia does this with every launch, they move the goalpost), then this has to be the first amd gpu that beats nvidia in both raw performance and in their own gimmicks
so if you decide to stop using a service, how can you compel the company to delete information it has on you and stop using it?
so if you have some mild autism, whenever you hear any audio, first thing you'll do is concentrate on the compression.honestly though, i love music so much that i don't really care about the source/sound quality as long as i can listen to music conveniently
so if you think that all lives matter you also logically think black lives matter.
so imagine playing ps5 on your macbook with unlimited processing power.
so in this context what i have noticed are two categorizes aesthetics and performance.aesthetic programing is as if your woman decides the color of your curtains after you spent thousands of hours into building a house, its a type of programing that focuses on how the code looks, the count of lines, what words you use, the amount of numbers..
so in windows when you press [enter] it inserts a newline character as well as a carriage return character (whereas on linux it just inserts a newline character, as you would expect)

so is the us
so it mode should be what i'm looking for right?
so it only affects volume?
so it still looks awful at even 120hz with bfi
so it uses a few mbs of ram, big dealit's basically just a gui wrapper for dcc/ci protocol so if you want something less fancy i'm sure it existsbut this one looks good, integrates well with windows, has all the features you'd need (including custom keybindings, brightness harmonizations and auto-dim timers) and is mit licensed foss so what more could you ask?
so it's back to the generic one for me
so it's just a rumble or do they implemented something like the taptic/hd rumble etc?

so some strange lights started crossing the sky
so somehow callf1 is either based->f1() or based->base->f1().how is this happening automatically?
so tempting though bros....
so that should be an obvious indicator that amd is working with microsoft to make a good upscaler, something probably akin to nvidia’s dlss, but one that should hopefully work with every game

so you get access to 50 bucks worth of software for free?
so you have all these different systems operating on different components, and you have message passing queues to pass info between systems, whereas normally every object's data and functionality would just be in one blob / classand that's all for better multithreaded performance, but it really doesn't matter because game logic isn't very demanding on performance in the first place
so you have no arguments?my backups that i referred to “archival grade” are simply dvd+r, two sets of copies of data that can’t be lost, those are last resort backups, there are three other copies in existence
so you have to view it as a trade-off.

so you lock it in place one notch back you fucking idiott

so you're a single-issue programmer.
so you're just rebranding lock her up now?
so you're saying it's a good thing to have gnome still around in case the qt company in fact starts to build a walled garden around new major versions of the open-source release of their toolkit, which would leave the kde project with the rather unfeasible task of maintaining their own fork?https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=qt-open-source-statement

sure, more people can ride it now, but you're severely limiting yourself if you're using it when you don't have to.not having static types makes large-scale engineering a real pain, as you have to rely on convention where a compiler/type system would just provide guaranteesit's also worse than c++ for backwards compatibility, as no matter how many new async class constructor property mixins they add to the syntax, it's still using the same prototypical inheritance semantics underneath.

systemd makes things too easybasically op treats his os as a hobby and since systemd automates and manages many things op is saying you might as well use windows since it also manages alot of things automatically
systemd will eventually get replaced by something which does the same thing but which is not as bloated; however, it was necessary to have something better than upstart.often times in an argument, both sides have some core pieces of the truth, but just can't get along

teslas are set up to read road markings - what is it supposed to do if there are no road markings?
test
test in that order, ffv1 is your initial reference for fast speed/lower compression/largest file size, then you try the computationally more expensive encoders with higher compression ratios and see if they can capture on your machine.depending on what drive sizes you target you're either done even with the lossless files and can hand the videos off, or (more likely) if the intitial capture files are not small enough to cheaply hand everyone a copy

that and i would need to live with the knowledge that someone local to me had done so...i'm looking to re-purpose the device but i did however like the idea of being able to send files p2p
that and no one needs that many programmable keys.
that and privacy i'd say considering atleast with a laptop i can hide whatever im watching from my parents or anyone who walks into my room
that artist has caused me to ejaculate an unnatural amount semen.
that as the technological system becomes increasingly complex over time, that it will need to place increasingly restrictive controls on human behaviour in order to maintain itself?is there any way to refute that?
that author was a retarded kid trying to work on a project that was bigger than he anticipated with a language he didn't know
that being said, i should have done this directly in c
that being said, i would just keep it as a dedicated music screen or some other content you aren't staring at primarily
that being said, i've considered moving to the countryside
that being said, there's more fanboyism and consoomer culture
that being said, you don't want to allocate on the heap unless you actually have to

that bladder contains a static pressure and is compressed by the air above it when the tank is full
that book is complete.
that book taught me about the attitude i should have as an engineer
that build looks over kill for you though.
that case has no fans but allows for a better value gpu.https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vtcdp8
that channel basically ruins the linux, today search on youtube.
that cost tho, are the samsung 970s okay?
that could be tough to do without compromising the bladder.
that could turn a screen replacement into go buy a new console.
that definitely matters more than having more fans.
that depends entirely on the companyif you're the only person then you get to be a full stack monkey instead of just a front end or back end monkey if you're aiming to be anything greater than a bottom of the barrel wordpress monkey then you'll need to know how shit works so it couldn't hurt
that disturbs me.>and it's obviously being controlled by someone else like a puppet.i know that, the puppet-like qualities are creepy.
that disturbs me.what about that clip implies *anything* sexual?
that doesn't even look close apart from the wallpaper which i'd change anyway
that doesn't sound very free as in freedom to me.
that doesnt make any sense
that drop shadow is disgusting
that everyone who disagrees with me you is literally hitler?
that explains a lot actually.
that extra bit of vertical space makes a world of difference
that face reminds me of kyle maclachlan.
that fag in your pic related is whats wronghe literally lied to the investors, fucking sue that motherfucker till he cant afford a household!
that feature alone, is worth some of the pain associated with learning systemd.
that file name
that gap is present in all cpu heavy games.
that guide's fucking stupid too, it's literally just wow vs code looks so complex, let's dumb it down!
that guy is a mozilla shill
that happened before i even knew what torrents are
that has nothing to do with freedom of speech
that hasn't stopped me before.
that he is a mouthbreathing retard ofc
that helps
that image has never been more appropriate.
that image is verification thathttp://www.catb.org/esr/writings/sextips/work
that implies that /g/ can program anything
that info hasn't dropped yet.
that ipod model might be compatible with rockbox, which would remove the need to use itunes
that is a broad ass word my guy
that is behind why they opened it and focused so much on interconnects.
that is completely optional.faqs:> which version should i download?> how can i activate ltsc?> what does it have?> where can i download ltsc 2019?> what software do you recommend/should i install?see /fwt/ paste.>can you get the ryzen scheduler on ltsc 2019?no, and will never

that is cute af
that is entirely dependent on the problem you are trying to solve.
that is equivalent in price to a modern oled, if not more
that is exactly why i said that linum-mode is bad and bloated.personally i don't like/need line numbers, so i don't use anything for that.
that is how moot (hiroshima nagasaki's dad and founder of reddit) started off
that is interesting.
that is literally what i have
that is obviously true idk why i'd waste the energy to question it
that is one of my biggest issues with them
that is poverty level here.
that is their definition of stability.if you really want a stable distro with latest kde, just use fedora kde
that is to say, both don't even have one
that is ugly syntax.anyway, here's my unsolicited opinion: rust is just a slightly slower modernized c++
that is what causes library conflicts
that is what i got my fanny pack for
that is what we did, apparently it isn't supported by windows 10.
that is what you call a simp tax in tech world.the smarterest of us actually use dead peoples cc/vcc for all our expenses.
that is why it matters fuck you guy sare really fucking stupid.
that is why they don't push a new fucking update every day for large packages dumbass, trannyfox is at version 67 or 68 in gentoo.
that is, unless he can prove different :^)
that isn't a fucking circuit diagram you fucking blinkie
that just leaves, what, samsung and sony?
that just sounds like suicide with extra steps
that kind of shit is stupid, just put the java code in a function and you can call it whenever you want
that kinda looks like ass
that larger provider can then use your hidden small scale ranking system and serve those content rankings to a larger audience
that last loop is .
that last message was 100% written by a human female
that lead into way too much dependence on the us/anglosphere which letting the rest of the continent fade into obscurity, hence the reason we've lost so many companies and lag behind in tech
that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
that led me to cybersec
that level of awareness makes him pretty much less wierd than the mindless normalfag next door.
that little bitch-ass commercial with that song?
that logo is pretty metal
that looks much better, from the first pic i thought it had visible pixels
that looks qt.
that looks really cool, wish i weren't poor.also, why would you need to disable the headphone?
that low utilization is dogshit optimizations
that makes a lot of sense
that makes me hate dumb emotion-driven vegans even more
that may be for the best
that means no using chrome, you get mobile firefox and you get to run ublock origin on it
that means sweat.also wc.
that means you should write your code to be legible
that of course depends on the severity
that only misery awaits me if i ever do get into the tech industry
that phone is 100% not going to make you look rich.but you shouldn't be buying a phone for that purpose anyway, dipshit
that photo is already several years old
that pic is from like 2013
that picture is peak stupidity
that picture made me laugh
that poor girl.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moawf4nhouc
that post radiates basendess
that probably isn't possible
that really is nasty.>>77031179what's uptime?
that rebranding has happend quite recently that is another sign in my opinion that we wont get any chance to buy a 16gb hbm2 card in the next generation.the only application i care about is ml using keras
that rtx 2060 mobile probably runs as fast as a gtx 1650 on desktop.
that said, c is still king for most industries that do real work (look at cat or john deere..
that said, if it was good enough, a lot of businesses would consider mass deployment of it to save some money.
that said, linux is at a point that it won't go anywhere, and both being open means they can feed off of each other in terms of development
that said, op is autistic.
that same release group (utr on 1337) then did scrubs (currently up to season 7) proving not just animation can benefit from this
that screenshot is painful to look at.>bad colors>bad fonts>completely mismatching graphical elementshow the fuck people manage to get anything done while looking at that eyesore, i'll never know.

that shit has no games.
that shit is going to catch all the dust in my house, my chicken tendy crumbs and smegma.tell me how to get a macbook pro without retarded colander inspired speaker design.
that should be fine, but you're better building a desktop for that workload
that sign is in russian and says compiling, do not disturb.
that so many people use it and it doesn't even have its own toolkit is kind of an indicator that people like it for how it is
that software probably does some ram caching on system memory to cheat
that sounds hot
that sounds kinda stupid
that sounds so expensive for no actual reason
that spreads as fast as your retardness
that stuff just works.i plan to get t420 after christmas (when them are in stock
that stuff seems ultra complicated and i don't understand what the point of it is.
that sucks, hope it goes better next time
that tesla coil kit looks nice and super-cheap.do you have a good soldering iron?if you can afford it, buy some quality solder
that thing is like the physical manifestation of the 2000 millennium hype
that thing is literally a locked gaming pc
that thing is so weird, it looks like a thinkpad that was torn in half
that thing took forever to scan all those ancient obscure malwares
that top right key is a meme that's for sure.
that version where everything was in uppercase.
that warning is not for going to a form step you shouldn't be on
that was a full retard take that i couldn't watch seriously
that was a tv show you fucking stooge
that was actually a good an interesting video.
that was my first spreadsheet
that was not the point of his os, he wanted to make a programmer's playground in it, and i think he succeeded
that was one of the big things i wanted to know.
that was phenomenal.put me in the screencap.
that was the first time i ever watched flash videos/youtube, in 2006-ish i think
that was the last game i was interested in, now i can stay in loonux and stay on this card until it dies
that was the plan all along
that was the whole point of newspeak.
that was when they kicked out steve 'diversified' the product line and broke all their own software.when steve returned classic mac os worked again.
that way in theory if the workstation gets popped there isn't a possibility of the workstation leaking your real ip to an adversary (baring an actual escape vulnerability)qubes on the other hand is a standalone os comprised entirely of vm's
that way you think it's google's fault.
that will be a less efficient cycle, for exactly the same result.
that will come with time
that will get you through 95% of stuff anyways.
that won't happen unless they only allow paying users to watch any video on the site.
that works off the assumption we would have more control over our robobrains and chemicals than our current ones to be able to flood with so much dopamine that we die/never feel the torture
that would be a hellish job.
that would be fucking cool.femboy nonbinary retard
that would be pretty sweet.
that would be very unwise
that would destroy tdd and some other meme development practices that create the illusion of productivity, hence they don't bother.
that would get it banned from npm
that'll be a wipe and load
that's $400 for the base variant of a phone with not even a full hd display and an ips lcd one at that, as well as 3 gb of ram
that's a (you) problem not everyone else's
that's a big head
that's a boy
that's a consequence of most things not really werking at all
that's a driver problem or bad hardware.
that's a dysfunctional language.
that's a genuine thing to ask, after all, they supplied the hardware
that's a hwidgen-related kms activator because ltsc can't be hwidgenned normally
that's a lot bro
that's a lot of power!
that's a major disqualifying factor.>it's unlikely that any machine that would let you play the game from the cd as-is would be capable of reading a dvd.well my can
that's a practical problem.
that's a pretty homosexual looking hand you have there
that's a pretty reasonable thing to do, not as bad as dropping comic motif midway through film for no fucking reason though.
that's a really neat looking case, but i prefer my cases to be more console-like.
that's a square anon
that's a squat plug mate
that's a trick question anon, there hasn't been that many worthy albums in the last five years.
that's a very photorealistic render, op
that's about it.[spoiler]37,000 nested if statements is not artificial intelligence[/spoiler]
that's actually a really fun project
that's actually an interesting way to think about things
that's actually dangerously based
that's actually pretty neatos 8 was the first one i used, so i might try that out
that's all i fucking want from you.
that's all i need?
that's all its good for and if 4chan implemented those features i would never use it again.
that's all the config.>>77084565i don't have it, but by the looks of it it's quite bloated.
that's all tubescum
that's almost what i wanted to do
that's always going to be more expensive than it needs to as you have to also pay for the windows license.
that's amazing, how did he manage to look so retarded
that's amazing.
that's based
that's basic shit anyone can do, not really hard making what you posted.making something that dynamically reacts to size changes or introduction of new items, that's what gets me going.
that's basically what they are
that's because a good portion of macfags can't reason why it's good and that's by design
that's because everyone copied chief
that's because mpv.net is the stable version of mpv
that's because newer phones are increasingly locking their bootloaders anyway, neither device makers nor google particularly likes the existence of custom roms, since they both make their money by keeping you int heir walled garden
that's because shit tn monitors use pwm with low frequencies
that's because they view a certain policital climate as essential to their self-identity
that's borderline devops not sysadmin
that's bullshit and you know it, especially with a monitor
that's called disabling.
that's cool man, and for what you pay and play you are doing the smarter move
that's disgusting
that's enough to identify literally everyone on the planet if they use any content blocker
that's entirely within your browser.
that's ethnocentrist
that's even the general idea, server owners generally want their hosted websites to be accessed but not their operating system configuration and raw databases and so on.sure enough, this depends on there not being any extreme security holes, but the standard practices already are relatively solid and if you run the web server in a [podman or whatever] user container under another user account that itself has no access to anything else but the files it needs, that's pretty much safe for all practical intents and purposes if you keep it updated.
that's fair
that's far worse than not being able to do something because the software is not designed for that purpose
that's fine, you're into different games and a different gaming experience to other people.all you're doing is realizing that you're an individual.
that's fucking gay.
that's funny !
that's going to be really hard for your parents to see when you finally commit suicide, anon
that's goodcouple of years back there were people citing issues with their nos tubes being refunded because of false claims of them containing mercury
that's gorgeous
that's gotta be the most based comment on the whole board
that's great, anon
that's hot
that's how gnome avoids becoming an incoherent mess.
that's how i say it.
that's how it should be but leaks show them using mysql/php, just like most early-00 webapps
that's how it works
that's how retarded the rest are.
that's how the internet is supposed to look like.
that's how they came to be in the first place
that's how you get your wrist fucked up.
that's it
that's it.i..
that's just how the world works, charismatic marketing guys always winnot like technical guys want recognition anyway
that's just minified code to reduce binary size.imports in java only exist at source level, classnames are always fully qualified in the resulting bytecode.i bet the code originally was something like thisimport static com.bytedance.android.livesdk.somepackage.someclass.somestaticmethod;// ...webresourceresponse a2 = somestaticmethod().probablysomegetter() .injectthisshitlmao(str, webview);
that's just poorly designed
that's just wordpress, there's tons of other shit built with php
that's kind of funny, 2bh
that's kind of what i'm trying to accomplish.be creative, /g/uise..
that's kinda based ngl
that's like if someone made a car that could only be driven with a guitar hero controller and you said i'm handicapping myself by not knowing how do drive with a guitar hero controller
that's like, 1/5th of the haskell programmers in the world in this one room.
that's literally it
that's literally just react native
that's literally the exact same setup as an intel chip
that's merely an aid as of today, not a replacement
that's my fetish
that's my only complaint against it
that's my point: emacs good, gnu emacs bad.
that's nice, i guess.
that's not a communist fist
that's not a full size board
that's not a vertical mouse.
that's not an iso keyboard retard
that's not an option if you wanna seem like a different person
that's not an s20
that's not even high sierra, that's just sierra, and i don't see why you wouldn't use catalina since it has more features and works better
that's not how it works, retard
that's not how it works, retard.
that's not it's intended purpose thoughanyone can hack a protocol to do something it wasn't meant to do, or isn't optimized for
that's not my public ip
that's not needed though with proper configs
that's not ok, anon!
that's not quite true
that's not saying much
that's not self evident, if the specs is designed to reduce performance then it will
that's not the gtx 970
that's not the hot take you think it is
that's not the reason why its' soulful, anon.
that's not to say that everything in doom is blazing fast
that's not true anymore considering epic is suing google as well who lets you install third party stores
that's now a sub-$400 card
that's offensive terminology
that's one of reasons safari is better at battery life actually
that's one of the best monitors of its class
that's one way if you're building it yourself.
that's orthogonal to the economic system you brainlet.>>77066713in some regards yes, but they left themselves wide open to cultural control by outside capital, unlike china.
that's practical in a mobile setting.my point is that android is nothing but those apps
that's pretty cool, i didn't even know something like this is possible in draw.i love it when programs are used entirely outside of their intended use cases.>>77402512shut the fuck up if you aren't contributing

that's pretty much for all iot thingsjust put those things in a different vlan and don't give them access to your computer network

that's rape
that's really bad bait, but i'm bored so i'll take it
that's really fucking ugly.
that's retarded.
that's rude, nigga
that's russell crowe.is he doing a biopic?
that's so retarded i can't believe it.
that's some weird cope
that's some yueg implying there friendo
that's still a layer though, it's just one engaged by holding down a different key rather than pressing it
that's still fine for 1080p60
that's tech nigger not mental outlad
that's the first thing i did
that's the only limitation that matters.
that's the only way i can think of doing it without explicitly declaring each array myself.
that's the only way to really be in touch with the state of things, instead of driving numbers and looking only at reports.i guess there is a certain art to management, just like everything, and unless you can learn to enjoy it and have fun with it, you won't get to be with it for much longer.which, on the flip side, turns out to be okay, because if you're not really with it, it stops changing and it stops being anything, so you eventually no longer need to deal with anything you are not really into
that's the plan for my media pc
that's the platform retardapply that logic to a tv station or newspaper
that's the point of the whole film..
that's the real motivation behind snaps, flatpaks, and appimages, application upstreams don't want to do that
that's the reason i got mine and it feels glorious.get one, anon.
that's the reason that there's no progress and you have pozzed distros.
that's the same exact problem.
that's the thing with these people
that's the thing, i prefer closed back headphones.i don't intend to use them for studio mixing or anything so will the £40 chinese bluetooth headphones do the trick, or will the sound quality be wank?
that's true
that's ugly af senpai
that's unfair
that's very tech too.
that's what an operating system is
that's what gentoo is.specifically, gentoo is a distribution of gnu/linux.linux is an operating system, but by itself, it's a very bare-bones operating system
that's what happens when your black women accuse you of racism
that's what happens when your country is made by masons, run by jews, and filled with niggers
that's what i always say.

that's what you really want
that's when these neural link projects started.
that's when tv commercials started putting aol keyword ____ at the end of the ad
that's where the dangerous part comes in
that's why /g/ has so many quality threads.
that's why everything's fancy as shit and bloated now.
that's why ffi is a thing: to reuse c libs.heck, java has convoluted ffi yet it did get a solid traction.what boomer did get right is that rust doesn't add anything of enough worth to switch.
that's why i have an intel laptop instead of ryzen.
that's why i picked one up and am working on my general license
that's why i ported it
that's why i said it
that's why i write all my keyboard firmware from scratch on paper in hexadecimal and then use ocr text recognition to compile it (they could be logging my keystrokes)
that's why i'm getting info from two different places, a chao.[whatever] will return the chao's neutral expression, which is unique to them and thus stored in their .json file, whereas the mood function i posted at first will decide if it should grab its unique expression or a mood expressionas for why i'm not posting code this pile of rancing bullshit has 900+ lines and i have no clue where i should begin posting it
that's why it took so long to get 2.8 to work.
that's why it's a meme not worth thinking about.
that's why risc-v is lingering in limbo while arm is headed to the moon.
that's why the ban had essentially no impact
that's why the mac costs so much, its quality.
that's why the the window buttons are in the upper right instead of the upper left, why they have a taskbar at the bottom instead of a menu bar at the top, and why the desktop icons are aligned to the left side of the screen instead of the right
that's why there is no logical xor in c or c++.
that's why they are trying to kill them off
that's why they are winning.ideally every child with iq above 130 (2 sd) would be sent to a special school with only other smart kids - all expenses paid by the state
that's why they had to steal code from google.at least google makes their shit open source so i can use ungoogled versions of their stuff.
that's why they shill it so much.>>77695428mainframes don't run unix
that's why they tested samsung's manufacturing process.but the next card will be on tsmc 5nm.it will have 4 times the current rt performance.dlss will be available on any game.and it will be much cheaper than anything else done before thanks to the chiplet design.i have my sources.
that's why they were able to pack so much onto them
that's why usenet is better.
that's why we don't see schizos who say everything is cool because i'm not remotely interesting to anyone or anything.
that's why we go to university, and why bootcampers aren't qualified to be actual engineers.for fuck's sake, even two o(n) algorithms can have pros and cons
that's why you use python right?
that, however, took a few days
that, or cold emailing

thats a waste of my time>>79398716>hiredpeople answer your dumbass questions for free retard>>79399966of course theres plenty of cases where questions dont get handled properly but i dont blame then, helping idiots is a tiring and thankless task
thats actually badass.
thats because its the classic version not the pro retardthe classic is old and shit, the pro is good
thats better than the global average.
thats extremely funny actually
thats firmware binaries bro
thats fucking retarded, just because its locked doesn't mean it was stolen or at least not stolen by the guy who currently has it
thats good anon
thats great and all but do you have gold xp?
thats it, too poor for mac
thats just a shitty hack tho
thats my first post thoalso i dont obsess, i discard, when i see >tranny on the cv
thats neat i guess, im actually thinking of setting up bongo instead and creating playlists once though
thats not even right, it doesnt feel glued together at all
thats not what i said

thats sad
thats some weird shit, hope u improve m8
thats the case linus torvalds uses actually.
thats the joke
thats what tab, arrow, and modifier keys are for.
thats why
thats why everyone always says but what about muh mary currie when they hear there are no historical female scientists
thats why it'll probably never become a proper national currency.there's even more dirty hacks / drawbacks in the protocol that i remember thinking of when i read the protocol spec a while ago, but i cant recall them now.
thats why manufacturers dont do it, its a lot of space
thats why this makes no sense to me and there's nobody to contact about it
thats why you can't run the witcher on a chromebook
that’s based.
that’s literally it.what kind of autism prevents people understanding such simple concepts?

the *.d directories are like>have a daemon/server/whatever>it has a config file something.conf>addition to that it also reads stuff from something.dnot everything in the world follows this practise.

the .7z format in ultra mode is also better than .rar at max compression.did freetards actually make something better than its commercial alternative for once?
the 10 gb of the 3080 is really spooking me
the 12 year olds of this generation have been entertained by these exact garbage comments for years now.
the 1660 ti beats it
the 1660ti is only 30% faster has 2gb less vram and the cheapest one on ebay is $230 for the shitty single fan cards
the 1k chip also has a magic backdoor, so i can program keyfobs onto it using my proxmark and use it in hotels etc.i also have a magnet implanted in my finger.
the 1st can't arrest me
the 2000s were weird like that.i kept it for a backup device in a closet for, and i've used it a couple of times for that
the 2015 seems more advanced.links:https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/
the 2060 costs $349, and it's technically more of a 2050 since all the tiers got bumped up a level with the removal of the titan series at there lease of the rtx series
the 2070 rtx costs $499, which is $170 more
the 2080 super won't get the big p/p like the 1080ti, but rumors said nvidia got fucked by sam fab that outside of raytracing, which one use anyways, it's still good.
the 2080ti is maxing out thermal limit i've set in afterburner at 85c
the 2080ti was especially bad though, even as far as price-inflated enthusiast cards go
the 2500k and 2600ks are the colt 1911 of cpus
the 3060 probably won't drop until 2021
the 3070 will likely be $700 and the 3080 $1000
the 3090 or even the 3080 and 3080 ti when it's released are technically capable of blowing this upcoming generation of consoles completely out of the water, and probably only approaching parity in two generations past that
the 360 arctic will be better than the 360 ek
the 3:2 2k display really makes it attractive.
the 4000-series cpus might or might not be a big step up in memory timing (and speeds that it can typically handle), i'd wait a little unless you need it right now.gpus: just wait™ - i know this is about cpus, but cpus aren't taking big leaps until 2021 at least
the 4200g looses to the 3400g while costing more and the 4400/4700 are much more expensive.
the 4chanx browser extension which everyone uses turns 4chan into reddit.

the average guy not running a $1200 gpu with a 1080p monitor, won't notice any real difference.things to think aboutintel: since you need to remove the boost limit to run at the max turbo frequency for more than almost no time at all, and it'll draw around 250w at that point (yes, i'm serious), you'll need the largest aio water cooler you can afford

the basic failure of the free linux desktop is that it's, perversely, not free enough.there's been a string of linux desktop quality problems, specific incidents reported by linas vepstas, jon masters, linus torvalds and others, and reading the related g+ discussions made me aware that many oss developers don't realize what a deep hole we are in.the desktop linux suckage we are seeing today - on basically all the major linux distributions - are the final symptoms of mistakes made 10-20 years ago - the death cries of a platform.desktop linux distributions are trying to own 20 thousand application packages consisting of over a billion lines of code and have created parallel, mostly closed ecosystems around them

the fact is, free software matters to developers and organizations primarily, but on the user side, the free code behind linux desktops is immaterial if free software does not deliver benefits such as actual freedom of use.so, to fix desktop linux we need a radically different software distribution model: less of a cathedral, more of a bazaar

the fun thing is that they suffer the apple syndrome, this idiots will come at you and blame you for using their software wrongly, if this doesn't work then they start blaming the other devs for not implementing what ever meme they felt like using.sway is like installing gnome but without all its commodities so whats the point of that bloated thing?

the ibm 360 family cpu's don't have hardware support for a stack, but they do actually have an instruction to do memory-memory block xor, so for once it was even simpler to do in asm than it would be in c, just 3 xor instructions.

the language hasn't hit the critical mass to develop a community to start popping libraries like python has but its simple syntax and performance should get more attention than it has.for social science r is enough it is slower than python and it has a much smaller community (but the people that contribute to crans are of much higher quality than most python packages).idk what you understand for big data but if you want to navigate through large databases you will need to complement r/python with tools such as hadoop, spark and sql which is probably way more technical that what you need to do

the only thing i've seen is samsung claiming it isn't a recall, while also claiming they need to send every g9 back through quality control.so it might as well be recalled.

the only thing pixel has going for it is the camera, and the camera really isn't that far ahead
the only thing that benefits from diversity is marketing, since black people will know better how to market to other blacks
the only thing that could be argued is an advantage rust ever had over c++ was the borrow checker which is like a compile time shared_ptr that prevents dangling references
the only thing that holds me back are the oldass packages and canonical magic (bloat) all over it
the only thing that isn't running stable enough on linux for me is star citizen, but that's an unstable trainwreck to begin with.
the only thing that makes him different to us is his availability to think very clearly and to practice logical results
the only thing that makes me doubt that i have autism is seeing people like this.
the only thing that took more than 10 mins with gentoo was chromium.and i use an ivy bridge 4c/4t cpu.

the only thing wasted is the breaths you take, because you have the imaginative abilities of a fucking mollusk and have already consigned yourself to inconsequentiality

the only things i keep up to date is my browser and antivirus program.
the only tutorials i can find are for sprite animations

the only way glowies could covertly surveil you would be if they physically tampered with your device
the only way to avoid it is by not going online in the first place which has the same effect.
the only way to get rid of that remote management profile is if it's retired from the mdm admin portal
the only way to use c++ on windows is with msys2, which is a unix shell that includes pacman which can install the whole toolchain and any libraries you need.
the only way you'll ever get put on a watchlist on tor is if you're visiting an illegal site, say a black marketplace or an illegal porn site - and even then the only way you'll get caught is if it's a honeypot site purposefully put up by government agencies to catch the degenerates who use those types of sites.basically, just don't do anything illegal or stupid with tor and you'll be safe, there's plenty of interesting and perfectly legal sites to browse on the deep web.
the op says pico you fucking retard
the open source community enables this behavior by providing all the implementations needed to accomplish just about anything, all pajeet needs to do is copy/paste some code to get shit working
the open source is a facade, it's a proprietary blob, and becomes retty much an empty shell if you build from the little source available.
the operating system came out when i was in 4th grade
the orange man didn't do this, it was this way since they abolished slavery.
the original article is from a fucking apple shill.https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/28/an-iphone-makes-you-76-more-attractive-on-dating-appsnow i don't give a single fuck about what that retarded youtuber (who even didn't link the original article, had to find it myself) or op says.
the original coomers
the original intel macs that came out in 2006 were only supported until snow leopard(2009) and for the mac pro lion(2011)
the original movie is probably the best cyberpunk movie that ever existed as of today, the second movie is also great but less impactful than the first, and standalone complex is more like a police series but also pretty good on it's own.none of the three is going to leave you indifferent after watching them.
the original was in node.js, another language i learned because mentally ill people wont stop talking about it
the original x86 patents have actually expired
the os was just a simple loop to let us pick from a few playback options and song lists
the osm pussies will go after the little guy, but are too cowardly to take on a real company
the other anons are right
the other data is all driven by volunteers and most of the contributers don't understand the terms of the license.>they don't want shitty proprietary big tech to come in and take everything they haveagain, you keep demo-ing you don't know anything about the license or the situation
the other night he told me windows update took 3 hours, and i know that twice a year windows replaces all installed files, like ubuntu or something.this guy could buy a raspi, hes got multiple old lattitudes and usb drives to learn more about computer wizardy, but he buys ingame items from the 'gatcha' game
the other problem is obviously the fact that a lot of sites are not fully compatible and tested (mainly in terms of css - you really have to tinker a lot to get some things to properly render)
the other way around
the outer log would lot an empty array because there's a .then() call

the people suggesting a demo party instead have the right idea though.

the perfect language in terms of aesthetics
the performance programing focuses on a particular goal and everything in between is just a means to reach that goal, they analyze the problem from the foundation and write something that interacts with it in the most perfect manner, words, letters are just meaningless vessels for their end goals, the code is more of a tool if the tool doesn't work then they throw it all away and use another one more appropriate for the job.you see in my binary category system both have to exists to validate each other, if one is missing the other doesn't exist, they need a seemingly opposing category to be able to critique each other
the performance will also be faster than the desktop ryzen 7 4750g which features around 2.15 tflops performance at the stock 2.1 ghz clock speed.raja actually did it guys
the peripheral devices used are mostly the same and independent of the soc
the person who does that is not an engineers
the person who writes those libraries is an engineer
the phone itself is fantastic and i've got no complaints besides no headphones jack
the pixel 3a is better (not heavy, very light, good screen and performance, comparable) than the pixel 4/xl
the pixel 4a is listed for preorder everywhere, when is the actual release date?
the plastic the pins sit on broke off so a cable wouldn't sit right
the plate is solid, the case is really easy to open upnegative points are the filco-style stabs and the 5.5u spacebarneutral points: no aftermarket keycap-set will fit due to spacebar, cable not detachable
the platform has a shitton of potential: almost everyone already has one, it's essentially a controller with advanced stuff (gps, accelerometer etc.) built in
the playbook was arguably the best tablet ever.
the point here is that they are open about it and much on that list is quite relevant to this topic.
the point is that by making these complex systems, their deficiencies lead to situations where a developer/user is being kept from doing what they need to because the software's own complexity gets in the way
the point is that gcc and cmake cause conflict between the person using it and the program
the point is, you can create a number of web services for different groups of people and you have full control over your data
the point is: netflix is becoming bigger than cable and they are on the aomedia's av1 ship.
the point of gentoo is to turn you into a monsterbrain so that you no longer need gentoo
the point of having large ondie caches would eliminate the need for ram and thus reduce wait time of the cpu in magnitude to how fast they could make the bus lanes inside the die.
the pokeball doesn't do anything, high-leveled pokemon won't respect the trainer unless he's gotten enough gym badges.ash's charizard was like that, it's one of the basic gameplay mechanics.
the popular gnu software is pretty stable and gnu even developed a reputation for writing large bloated programs yet covered every edge case and had little bugs.
the popularity is mostly from word of mouth and social media

the price of sql server holds me back
the price to performance just isn't worth it.
the prices are so high because they expect you to have an employer who invests an annual amount of money in your education
the printing look alright and it was 23.65€.
the problem is in the nominally
the problem is mainly that each soc has its own boot procedure, and there are many low-level devices connected more directly to the system bus in ways that cannot be detected in a standard way, so the kernel needs to be compiled with hard-wired knowledge of their addresses and such.
the problem is obviously developers don't want to work out every distro's special snowflake solution to this problem.it would be much better if someone made something like the aur that was capable of working with multiple package managers, rather than just redundantly reimplementing the functionality of perfectly fine package managers just to ignore the problem and consequently shitting up the filesystem by installing dependencies the user already has>try getting a program to run that was abandoned 10 years agothis is the exact same problem anyone who wants to make a package has
the problem is plastic molded shit
the problem is semantics can be used to make language less efficient to express ideas that aren't fashionable by whoever is trying to force the semantic shift
the problem is that it is chromium, even without google shit.see >>78599815>>78600081https://privacytools.io/browsers/#addonshttps://www.ghacks.net/best-firefox-addons/
the problem is that the distributors are totally unmotivated to spend any money at all on even a single person to manually check on players and have abandoned all cheat detection to scripts.
the problem is that the white becomes washed out
the problem is that there is no scenario where that would happen and there wouldn’t be charges you have to fight in court
the problem is that this isn't how it works in practice
the problem is the insane bootstrapping for js projects
the problem is, in modern webdev you don't actually write the red box and give it a shadow.you use some front end framework like bootstrap or whatever to do it for you.and half a year later you hear that bootstrap is outdated and nobody uses it anymore so you switch to materialize.and 2 months later you realized that everyone in the industry already moved on to whatever the fuck else.sure, the idea of creating that red box is always the same, but webdevs have to relearn how to do those easy things over and over because there's always that new framework or collection or script that now is the way to go.it's hell for everyone else and i'm pretty sure webdevs only like it because they're masochists
the problem is, when i connect everything, other devices connected to the main router downstairs can't seem to find my two devices in my room.i think it is because the second router (used as a switch) is assigning my devices different ipv4 addresses
the problem with attributing value to a network, is that 'the powers that be' get in and price out innovation.if a decentralised network were to scale, it's uses would be limitless, attributing value to the network would just be limiting some of it's utility.
the problem with cheating isn't that it's hard to stop someone from connecting and playing once banned
the problem with every language isn't the language itself, it's the fanboys
the problem with reddit is that their niche communities are affected by the hivemind
the problem with the registry is that it's a single file
the problem with this approach is that the only small devices i can find need to be retrieved afterwards to collect the data; while this is absolutely an option for mapping the normal route by setting up a net made of mesh to catch it downstream, there's no real way to do this with the alternate route as it changes with each storm based on intensity so there's no realistic way to collect or even locate the device after the storm as it could end up anywhere
the problem with using the filesystem is that there isn't a clear hierarchy for the tags (does it go album/flac/song?
the problems don't exist, if i lower texture resolution - reduces vram usage.

the question is if i can run flatpaks without bubblewrap or use my own preferred sandboxing software.
the question is, will gnome accept the patch?
the question is..
the question is: does the evidence prove to a reasonable degree that you, the suspect/defendant, committed the crimes

the real devs, like 5/ 100, the ones that do the actual work don't have a comfy life and the taxes are insane
the real intelligence still stays with the product mgrs since they want to remain in power
the real problem in comparison there is that warframe is an actual game while star citizen is the framework of a game.whenever i remember i have an account and try it out to see what is new, i always find game breaking bugs within minutes and find they have added things unrelated to the original core concept while the original core concept remains unfinished and the parts of it they have implemented are janky.warframe is a game
the real problem is that i don't have 250k or whatever the fuck this costs.
the real problem isn't that though, it's that the thumbnail grid view is inefficient and slow as fuck
the real question is whether cybernetic implants are going to have a diy/foss/open hardware scene or if everything's gonna have shitty backdoors and proprietary hardware, and you'll never know what it's doing to your mind in the background
the real question is..
the real question though, why would anyone in their sane mind want to sell a goldmine like arm?
the real trouble was undercooked feature updates, and now they push those when your current one's almost expired after like a year and a half.
the reality in so many companies is that they want something done as fast as possible because every second they don't have the tool in their mind is lost business
the reality it's not as black and white
the reason for this is a big screen has lots of little magnetic anomalies all over you can't degauss out completely
the reason for this is that the programs are doing more than they ought to
the reason is because godot is completely open source and mit licenced, so they can do whatever the fuck they want with the engine which is very important due to the regulations around odds and payouts
the reason many users use distro package managers is because they don't
the reason there hasn't been a new release yet is because wm4 isn't finished rewriting the audio api
the reasons i have gathered are 1) it's so much easier, 2) direct x, yet he didn't even know why the console was named the xbox
the recent kuroba versions are so bad that it even brought floens back from the dead
the regular userspace permissions apply afterward, and ring -1 access is easily exploited via any usb connection after that.

the team is responsible for the overall quality of the code that gets pushed to production, not individual contributors.
the technology for that is arguably non-trivial:- it would require a safe sandbox enforced both on the kernel and on the user-space side

the themes of the visual album would be on prehistoric animals and landscapes, african wildlife and landscapes (jungles, savannahs) drawing my main inspirations from that short cgi demo from 1984 called high fidelity, and b0dyg0d's avs series on yt, because i love abstract shit and eye catching color palettes

then it will either split again like how the linux community is employables running ubuntu and all the spergs jerking their little irrelevant dicks dry running arch, gentoo, slackware, or hipsters will just migrate to something more stupid and obscure like haiku or plan9, then the process will repeat

there is not a single ithing out there that has ever had any kind of flaw whatsoever.every time an ithing hasn't been working correctly, it's been the owner's fault for using it wrong.no, that's not correct, but it's apple's position and it's what many of their customers actually believe.

there's already ai capable of identifying features (tags) of an image *booru style.it should be possible to generate an image based on tags you input, by training it to generalize individual tags on a site like danbooru, for instance.it is not as simple as reversing the process a deep neural net would use to tag an image, though, but i'd like to explore it as a project since i already tried making a bot to automatically tag images.

there's at least one card that straight out of the box is set to serious overclocking and is by default overvolted so reading all these negative reviews it's pretty plain to me that while up to half are early driver issues (of course) the rest are mostly people who are not just overclocking the fucking things but also massively overclocking their cpu and probably more than a few are trying to do it manually without realizing what happens while fine tuning a manual overclock.i guarantee you it /g/

they are worthwile, but they are not as good as a naked gf vacuuming hard to acess places if you know what i mean.as wrote >>77105115 it means less dirt in open spaces and slightly less in hard to access places, where it can be pushed by your movement around the place (behind the open doors etc).if you get one, start it first time under your supervision to deal with all problematic furniture before something smash on it.
they aren't
they aren't avistaz.
they aren't because its not cool, once it is it will be swarmed by mediocre professionals that do it for the twitter likes.source?

they banned 4chan temporaily because of tarrant, they only used a dns block thank fuck
they basically just log a line of text for what directory is accessed and a lot of time its logging same directories over and over making the logfile huge and not real easy to interpet the movements of the user through the folder system.hopefully there is a software out there with a better interface that easily lets me see what device (device name) is connected to me and exactly what directory that device has accessed and at what time
they blasted through it claiming no issues, everything works as described and expected
they both suck
they both work fine.

they come without sata cables.you have to put your os on it, that is the point of getting one.yes.crucial, wd and samsung give you tools to clone your files from your hdd to your ssd.avoid kingston and pny and no name brands, avoid qlc ssds, avoid dramless ssds if you will have your os on it, avoid ssds with phison controllers unless they are pcie 4.0.get a crucial mx500, adata su800, samsung 860 evo.>what about m2 nvme drivesuseless for gaming, they have exactly the same performance than sata ones but they are more expensive.
they constantly need something to lash out at and blame for their own personal inadequacies, not unlike sjws.further testing will be conducted tomorrow.footnote: awareness of experiment does not hinder wintard raging and seething in the slightest
they continue to keep up hong kong servers despite the new security law
they could infuse their souls energy into stone, creating demons that would do battle we can infuse our energy into digital entities but on some computers they are not compatible which is why alien operating systems are the same as unix as they can summon their demons
they could just work together on a standard, i'm talking about flutter btw
they could've ended up like purism.besides that, they have very few options for components
they created clover 4chan appbut in fact they are not a white man>github profile has cat picture >floens (florens)>florens is a spin on the name florence>florence is the 15th most popular name for females in europethis means floens is likely a tranny or a europe femaledickcheese is a black manwhite girl, black man you get the connectionuse dashchan stop using clover or kuroba
they created ember, angular, react, node, typescript, npm, babel, and so on
they deserve it
they did a whole thing about why they do touch gestures on the trackpad instead of touchscreens as the weight of your arms diminishes the efficacy and comfort of what you are doing (i know this is solved with those 2 in 1s but apple refuses to make them due to durability and aesthetic reasons)
they did change backed to their linking in places so some may fail
they did it so chink resellers cant install a custom botnet rom onto your device before shipping it to you, based retard
they did the same to nokia during the symbian days

they didn't always have that
they didn't take the jobs you fucking mouth-breather
they do a good job on balanced specs
they do however extend all the way down to 20hz, and bass accuracy is high, so it'll sound fast, or rather, you'll hear the impact well, even if there's a lot of them in a short amount of time, whereas in many headphones bass is loud but sounds like a boring drone.the appeal of hd600 is that they're accurate, and that's what they're bought for
they do it to test you, understanding durka english is incredibly important for working on software at a big company

they don't have many customers
they don't have to be on youtube, i'm totally fine using rss.
they don't integrate because there isn't much to integrate into (except google's botnet)
they don't know why though
they don't look right (especially gtk header bars).
they don't maintain their own browser engine and just piggyback on blink thus have more time to work on the ui.
they don't markedly react in the combustion
they don't mention it, but this is was specifically introduced for gab>https://f-droid.org/en/2019/07/16/statement.htmlgab was turned into a centralized service when everyone on the fediverse is required to ban them
they don't need to see what's on it unless maybe if you've plastered it with i <3 loli and love at any age stickers.

they have no choice
they have plenty of airflow after you install a couple case fans
they have security extensions.3
they have since changed something on the ink series and released v2 inks
they have the win10-related telemetry shit included if you were wondering but the neutralizing guide manages to gut off the backported components.alternative way wise, you can use whdownloader from mdl to acquire updates and integrate them with abbodi's w7ui-whd or msmg toolkit (not sure if msmg allows you to also download the updates from it, can't be sure)
they have to be labelled hotswap, otherwise they are soldered on.

they look like pretty much the same product to me, but does any have an edge over the other?

they made him fight with his parents, got him kicked out, and he wandered around hopeless until his death, which may well have been a suicide.
they mainstream enough that they can afford educated workers that know how to spot security holes and patch them.4
they make a huge difference especially if you're a noob
they make it for retards and retards like
they make it through college somehow despite being nearly computer illiterate

they might've worked 10 years ago but most are bullshit that graduate retards and nobody takes them seriously
they must be pretty busy getting shit done.
they must be too dumb to learn linux it's not that hard.

they pretty much make sure they can't actually repair anything, by contract
they probably only put it on google play a few months back so that they could pull this stunt.
they probably put a resistor on the 3.5mm jack to decrease volume for iems and sensitive portable headphones
they probably will soon though with the way things are going
they produce a lot of junk because thanks to china'a currency manipulation, the cost of doing dumb labor is cheaper even than machines, to the point you can just ignore faulty products.but as soon as you move from making a simple board or soldering an already made part onto a board china's completely gone
they produce even better code but avoid dealing with them outside of code because of obvious reasons.
they pull the mafia shake down shit on you.nice channel you got there pitty if someone dmca strikes it.linus is the big dog of tech channels so of course they wont fuck with him.so him saying>oh it is rare and if it did happen i could just buy the product.is worth its weight in dog shit.i think the fact that gn put up so many screenshots of them pulling that shit, makes his rare argument invalid
they put a rocket engineer in front of windows and he struggled to figure it out
they record video.
they reject primary sources and technical knowledge.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_q7rejtilu
they removed google play music
they rotate in pricing.>you don't need a full tower
they routinely get people wrong and all you have to do to confuse their matches is wear a bandana or be black and they'll think it's the same criminal.the chinese facial tech software actually works and that's among a population of over a billion people who all look alike
they ruin the sound
they run a community school for the programming language every few weeks, and they have good documentation
they run modified bsd and windows and are more similar than even android is to linux.
they said 500
they say it's best because it's what any person would be capable of using, not because of vantages themselves
they say very clearly on the site before you buy that this is not a general consumer device, it should be for tinkerers and developers only.
they see it as a strategic risk because any muppet can put together a spreadsheet without any standards of development

they seem to be only competing who can increase their prices faster.
they seem to pretend as if they have a backdoor to everything but in reality seem like that is barely even the case
they seem useless.
they seem very cheap for what they have and i'm hesitant to make a purchase because it just seems like such a good deal.
they send niggers to the olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers
they shape opinions, try to manipulate you into buying shit, hoard data that gets sold and even stolen and it's gonna get even worse.typing something into google should net the same results for everyone, unfiltered
they should also be less fatiguing: you should be able to wear them all day round, if you e.g
they should be multi-threaded
they should copy flashfxp which is only abandoned because the dev went to prison for having hidden cameras in his house that caught an underage girl masturbating.
they should go for facebook and limit data collection/selling of said data but the government doesn't want to lose their precious honeypots
they should have their own smart phone with tiktok installed as soon as they can read
they should make them as dim as possible.does anyone else cover all their power indicator lights with electrical tape?

they sound good in general, and they're very well balanced: they're not bad at anything
they sound like they're gonna housefires judging by the rumored tdps
they sound listenable as opposed to unlistenable, but the cipher is just an eq applied by the chip that can be replicated with any software peq solution
they talked about it on irc channel
they technically pay my salary, so no.
they tend to be humanitarian trash who think the idea of genetic filtering isnt fair and humane.
they then shop for orders via the fake account, compare prices, and mimic everything an actual customer would do, before finally making a purchase from their client's store
they think that by saying that everything new and modern and good that runs their entire world is shit, and also by saying that anything except their supposed fantasy of being some 60s mainframe programmer (yet ironically having no idea how shitty this would have been and basing their entire supposed history of this off of cheesecake vintage laboratory photographs) is shit, they believe they win good boy programmer points that they could cash in one day.anyone that actually wants to learn how to program, uses the internet to find a tutorial, gets an internship, and realizes that all your faggot books teach you is how to be the same token npc abstract programmer, also known as a not-programmer
they think your a retard and won't hire you
they took this from you
they took those cards off the market and rebranded them as the radeon pro vii changing only the headsink and i guess the drivers.https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/radeon-pro-viieach radeon pro vii costs 5050

they use lighter plastic, but the quality isnt bad
they use nigger slang like bruh and thot
they use oss tech everywhere, it's in every government's interest to have reliable technology free of any influence and not tied to a certain country, so why don't they help fund oss projects with tax money depending on their needs?
they use the tools made for them, why wouldn't it be popular?
they used their empowerment to force him to humiliate himself and offer himself and kernel to feminism.
they used to be monsters in tech.
they used to be pic related
they used to not even let you use your own router/modem until someone bitched at them and took the case to court because its illegal, they really want you to use their provided one which you can't even access the options for due to safety issues
they usually suck, or are bloated monstrosities, but they're there.it's just daunting to scrap everything i know and dive off into something brand new
they want bugs
they want everything now
they want me to work for a toy website and shill their chinesium garbage as strangely amazing products (note i am not allowed to use their slogan as it might identify who these shitheads are
they want people to use their cloud bullshit and are already giving away windows for free
they want the power back and to be the kings of the world (even when its the jews in the end, truly).however this drama ends, we the people will be the most effected, and our children, if were lucky enough.
they want to be able to use whatever insane dependencies they want (either way-too-old versions that they froze so they wouldn't have to fix their shit, or way-too-new versions that they jumped to for some pointless new shiny) and not care about, eg, libraries getting patched for security issues
they want you to feel and for most people they're generally successful

they were 1000$ last i remember, best part?
they were already insane.
they were being ironic.
they were born in another era.
they were both nearly human in appearance, except they had yellow colored eyes, high cheeks, flat noses, and wide thin mouths
they were changed
they were dilating their axe wound when they noticed some crabs crawling around in their hairy gash.
they were extremely fast for their time but not really any more
they were generally awful...expensive, slow, and proprietary and thus brand werent interoperable
they were just cheap
they were live streaming like that one tianjin video that ends with debris flying at the camera.
they were lying about it sucking less.
they were my first candidates but there seems to be quite a few and i wasn't quite sure which one to start with>>77616077my first contact with programming was with c++ but i couldn't even get to the point where i'd use classes
they were neat machines at the time.
they were nothing but trouble
they were retarded>>77239224yes it's me that can't communicate effectively and not the person coming in and adding retarded comments completely unprompted to a pr specifically assigned to two other people
they were shocked, because hardly anyone outside from here thinks 4chan is anything other than /b/ and /pol/i myself thought the same back in 2010 or sothen i found out about /v/, then /g/ and i was hooked
they were the biggest bang for the buck at the time if you didnt want to talk with cocaine addicts on craigslist to get an old i5 or some shit
they were worse than nvidia in every aspects but price, also they had crazy design like the 4890.just looked at the prices and cried.
they weren't trying to shove in fancy hardware
they will and it will be infinitely stronger and more pure than mere hominids could ever experience.
they will be happy to vote for the next idiot who might be less cancerious
they will become powerful connections later
they will block the crawler just like archive.org's
they will help but nowhere near as much as just reinstalling
they will most likely fingerprint pixel data.but beyond that they want to create social conditions where a media file without such properties would be deemed bad and something that should not be shared.
they will tell you how much they hate niggers and how the mutt's law meme is a stale joke and they are just pretending to love niggers but the evidence speaks for itself in that america has always been and will be a nation of nigger loving niggers.
they won the cpu battle by a mile, there is no reason why you would buy a 10900k right now
they won't
they won't really drop, they will just stop selling them.
they wont waste $1000 on a phone
they won’t take the ipad back as they’ve phased them out and replaced them with chrome books
they work just as well.
they worship niggers like muhammad ali and michael jordan and michael jackson and while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over
they worship their zogbot police force disproportionately filled with niggers and their global police force of soldiers filled with niggers
they would have to write their own driver for graphic cards, but yeah, the massive amount of software available for aix would make owning such workstation worth something.
they would however never pick a lossless mode if they were forced to omit lossy.
they would still pay for it
they would take the mdl thread down had it actually pozz and simplix would have tainted his name by that
they would/will eventually have to cave to market pressure
they wouldn't have paid him anything.
they wrent even trying this time around.
they write you letters with the same code, only using your phone number.
they'd be automatically flagging and banning people every business day and not just for a few days before christmas or whatever.
they'd do a phone interview and i would ramble on and on how blacks are being forced out of these sectors
they'd have to do it gradually
they'd want to tax it.
they'll argue with you over 10 bux, never donate to charity, walk around in cheap sandals, etc
they'll be very impressed, probably make you team lead or architect or something cool.
they'll just push prices past $1000 and divide profits.
they'll mark it as a balloon or toy or something and in a solid box
they'll want me to go ahead and get my masters at some point, at the very least.i'm not worried about being too brainlet for it, but getting into a graduate program may be difficult
they're a wannabe google, you'd be an absolute idiot to use it.ddg is okay, better than google, but there's been reports of tracking and privacy issues
they're able to force tiktok to sell to a us company due to some laws that have to do with foreign corporations.the app itself is not banned, and this is a totally different beast from banning an open source network
they're airplane models dumb ledditor
they're all plugged in
they're all scams that get shut down i six months.
they're all shit anyways
they're all similar and all good, but the 66s are way overpriced and the 650 are a slightly bloated sounding version of the 600
they're already doing it.https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-now-streaming-av1-on-android-d5264a515202?gi=abd18c982f60youtube tried to push it on me too on my pc until i disabled it.
they're also built like tanks.
they're also the only distros that do parallel downloading by default
they're bloated yes but any more time consuming than chrome.
they're both pretty simple and equally understandably to me
they're cheap used, don't break and are completely self contained
they're creating a board for each genre so people can have actual discussion
they're dark brown australians basically.
they're designed to look good, not work good
they're expensive for a reason, and they're the most quietly driven and least turbulent fans i've owned to date.i'd do a similar test, but i own nothing with a low enough noise floor to pick anything up.
they're faster and cheaper.what's not to prefer?
they're fine but i kinda wish they were even tighter or a bit more clampy
they're fun to listen to and don't pump videos out daily so they won't burn out or run out of ideas like the first generation vtubers did (ai, luna, siro, etc.)
they're getting old enough that they're going enough places that i need to be able to stay in touch with them
they're good
they're healthy an i heard they keeps the doctor awaywhy is /g/ so fucking shit
they're just self aware enough to realise how outmatched they are, which is why they seethe so hard
they're just self aware enough to realise how outmatched they are, which is why they seethe so hardin all honesty, this is why i hate /g/
they're just supposed to look close enough to macbooks to lure in poorfags.
they're just trying to fit in with fake nerd cred.
they're likely different from the names shown in xrandr because nvidia doesn't like following standards
they're loud, i do not like it
they're making money hand over fist
they're mass spying programms and a cancer for society, i'm fully okay to mass banning them globally and make a non cucked gnu counterpart the only option.
they're not
they're not basic phones
they're not dead
they're not dumb, they're literally ccp agents here to shill
they're not g
they're not going to be in favor of the massive amount of cash that would need to be spent to replace it with a codec with even higher efficiency
they're not saying they have over 300%+ users
they're not wrong
they're not wrong, you know.
they're out of date as soon as they're printed.
they're pretty cheap and let you use your own domain name.
they're pretty much a generation behind
they're probably listening at dangerously high volumes
they're saving you
they're saying 63% of intel users use chrome
they're shit on windows and mac os too, you just take them for granted and don't think about how much they impede you in day to day use; they're actually better in linux but still shit
they're smaller and more portable for travel
they're smart, put in tons of effort to accomplish things, and can get into anywhere
they're socialists
they're sometimes already posting 8x bigger png just because.maybe a few big centralized social networks also will pick lossless modes for their image upload and/or even the server-side compression, but that remains to be seen
they're still free to have freedom of expression in japan.
they're still in alpha
they're still making excuses years after the event and trying to convince me to go back to die for their stock options, insider trading info, and of course glamour.
they're still sample&hold
they're still stuck with that chink runes, what were you expecting?

they're the lolbertarians of the tech world we should have complete freedom, that means there should be no regulations to prevent big corporations from exploiting us.
they're the maserati of tech.
they're the only ones that do it on a cpu that actually needs decent cooling to achieve it's advertised performance
they're the same of the class average while im pretty sure to be above average if not the best (hopefully for me)
they're the same thinkpad but the t410 has better specs.also consider the t430 or x230 if you can find one for a good price.
they're thinking of the nigger
they're thinkpad keyboards in a standalone case.
they're throwing mud and you're a mud golem

they're worse than cancer.
they're worse than ihs usually.
they're zoomer retards from /v/ who grew up with zero sense of privacy or freedom as basic rights, poltards who unironically support shit like killing net neutrality and godawful patriot act tier trash (majority of whom are boomers with a random indoctrinated zoomer here or there), and spooks manipulating the aforementioned groups.
they've asked me to either verify with another email account, or with a phone number.today however, it won't offer the email option and instead insists on a phone number
they've been on a downward trend for some time now and keep making retarded decisions
they've just been acting shifty with reviewers.doesn't mean their products are all inherently shit, but you know how fired up tards get with dishonesty.
they've probably been planning it since they started designing their own chips.
they've shat the bed so bad with their new process nodes that i don't really have any faith in them on that anymore.
they’re bluepilled and trans pilled.
they’re bots idiot.bots run 4chan

things like that
things like the difference between := and =, and the usage of %var% is something that trips me up a whole lot.one other thing (not sure if they optimized it at some point) is that imagesearch is really slow, especially if you have to call it a whole bunch of times
things like the difference between := and =, and the usage of %var% is something that trips me up a whole lot.totally agree, worst part of the syntax

this affects fuel consumption, energy use, drives up prices of foods and other goods/services, and leads to a net negative to any city that undergoes a renovation project (for the duration of it).worse, these projects are tied to bullshit cost plus contracts, which exist to milk the local and state governments for maximum money with the longest duration of time to completion (with no guarantee of success)
this aka faggot tax
this also gives them good resiliency against a potential 404 in the event a mirror quits hosting the repo
this also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination
this also isn't even taking vulkan into consideration (no idea how that part works; look at libplacebo for more details).

this could be a problem because then the cafe wifi router could have saved your mac address
this could be amazing for the future of the internet.anyway tl;dr are you optimistic about the future of decentralized computing enabled through blockchain/holochain technology?
this could be easy or impossible depending on your opsec.
this could have been an awesome years for laptop, but no, everthing that has a good cpu (amd) has shit parts and everything that has good parts has an intel housefire that can turbo boost to 900mhz for up to 12 seconds, at the cost of 1% of battery per second.

this doesn't necessarily decrease verbosity but it does increase readability.another approach is to utilize polymorphism.
this drives down cost to market, and locally sourcing in some cases is preferable to building factories out in india or africa or china, where a lot of cost is lost in having to deal with corruption or warring factions that could cause problems with supply chains.any faggot that has played sim city 3000 or 4 fucking understands this.

this happens at least once a day, sometimes multiples times a day and has been happening for the past few months
this happens every day, usually doesn't take more than 5-30 minutes depending on how much i've been doing the previous day.i also have another external hard drive that i plug in and synchronize with that internal hard drive on a semi-regular basis
this happens to me on mint when i let the pc alone for some time and it suspends, when i come back the hdd is stopped and the entire system has frozen
this happens, but for the type of content we are talking about here it happens rarely.>what should i write/do to make sure i dont get deleted?you could put effort in and do shit like warp the pic, pitch shift audio levels etc, but frankly then it'll just not be worth watching anymore
this hardly ever happens, it's just fun to shit on people who bought a historically overpriced high-end gpu which was made obsolete not even 10 months later by a card that cost half as much because the 2080ti was so stupidly overpriced.
this has legitimate merit
this has nothing to do with you having to log in.

this includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual's gender identity
this includes edm and hiphop.thus it'll be very different to whatever crap you're used to, but objectively better

this is harder to conceal than most combat size semi automatics and has drastically less capacity
this is hardly an argument against the stl seeing as any other language's standard library wouldn't contain such a specific implementation of a specific container to suit your needs either.in fact, the genericity of the stl and its algorithms will allow your custom container to interoperate with the rest of the stl rather seamlessly.

this is out of date and shilling for zsh1- you now have to pacstrap the kernel, so add linux and linux-firmware to the pacstrap command2- yaourt is deprecated, use yay if you want an aur helper, you'll have to install that from source, it's super easy though3- you don't need an login manager, it's blo474- you don't need systemd bootloader for uefiand thats just from a quick glance

this kind of reputation system allows people to go with the mass (and thus seek protection in numbers), or go with authority (and thus seek protection by delegated expertise) - or a mix of these concepts.the android market comes close functionally i think, except the truly distributed mesh network and structured reputation architecture, and it's not foss either, of course.i see elements of this thinking in the gnome3 extensions 'market' - but it does not really handle security nor does it guarantee a stable platform.free software has stupidly followed closed source practices 10-15 years ago and we never seriously challenged those flawed closed source software distribution and platform assumptions

this means that certain websites can specialize in certain topics/ types of content and can compete with the current social media giants.
this means that going forward, there will be different torrent versions.>these different (v1 and v2) torrents will also create separate torrent swarms
this means that i learned almost everything i needed to learn about html, css, javascript, api calls, authentication (jwt, cookies, crs) without ever having to actually deal with the frameworks.
this means that they are initially connecting via http before they are redirected to https, leaving them vulnerable to mitm
this means they can now not only install 'plugins' without your permission but also block any add-on and you can not do anything about it
this means you're getting twice the 5g corona cancer beams.

this piece of shit is hot garbage.>works on my machineshut the fuck up
this post has been delayed for that very reason, especially when so many people have given so much, and i feel they deserve a proper goodbye
this post is brainlet cope
this post is so fucking retarded its unreal
this problem is largely stemming from the push toward brighter, more vibrant, displays than anything else.configure your monitor suitably
this problem makes /sci/ unusable.
this property makes them ideal for exerting pressure on incredibly small areas.
this pushes other talent who isn't working for some racketeering organization like tub20 (again i must change the name to protect their privacy).
this quartine is pretty based.
this really bothers me
this reconstruction features a percept
this release is a mess
this reminds me, why do so many amoled panels have this color separation issue when it comes to white?
this results in a lower peak combustion temperature, air starves the reaction, and prevents the formation of oxides (namely nox)
this seems like it would benefit windows users more than it would linux users since now they can actually use exfat instead of fat without compatibility or performance problems
this seems like it'll go to shit once the masses find out about it
this seriously sucks
this shit crashes without fail when i type 'pl' in plot
this shit has changed my fucking life
this shit is amazing.they are superior in longevity, brightness/color options, shape availability, health risk, energy, and even now cost than it's predecessors.we've almost reached the end of improvements to be made
this shit is fucking cool.
this shit is great
this shit is just disaster1
this shit is so broken sometimes i think the home users are quality control and testing team while ltsc is production.
this shit is sold to multiple data aggregators.when you “delete” it, maybe it’ll get deleted from instagram servers (in a year or two or more, to get cycled out of all the backups etc if their servers).but they can’t control what the aggregators do
this shit never fails to make me laugh.
this shit was kino in terms of privacy>no central server>peer to peer>did not even need internet connection to work (how do you mitm this shit?)
this shit was pretty good.
this shits gonna be huge bros
this should be illegal.
this should delay 2004 while allowing wu to push 1909, after that set the feature delay back to 365 days (and hide the 2004 update with wumgr if it will appear)
this should help anonhttps://youtu.be/idlrt-yppbi
this simply means that maccers need to upgrade asap
this site doesn't even really say openbsd isn't secure...
this site is a leftover of #cancelstallman and was created by some gnu developers who participated in the cancelling to have a safe space
this so called strict mode is actually worse than nothing and not emdorsed
this so muchthe best wat to learn is to start a project and google literally every question you have
this song is a banger live.
this sounds too awful to not be a larp
this stinks of neet speak, get a job faggot.
this study makes sense for me.my life went like this:1
this stupid nigger had to publish his network analysis on how you can detect tor bridges just because they didn't pay the ransom money to shush him up and a day later tor is fucking blocked in my backwards third world shithole
this takes the general idea of whonix and runs wild with it
this tests your real world 4kb random read/write performance as 4kb pages are written to a page file and multiple random blocks are read/written to on the fly.when you patch an intel system this crucially important thing gets fucking mogged
this thead is only for the talk about the gmail of 2004 code not for anything else!
this thing is freaky as fuck if you ever see it in real life
this thing is fucking pointless for 90% of people will buy it simply for being a new reasonably cheap product
this thing is slow as fuck but can still emulate okay.

this thread is now about horse technology
this thread made me horny
this time managed to spend 6 months working on it
this took you two weeks?
this topic is not talked about much
this trash and python are the only two i cannot figure out why they exist at all and will never pick up again without a huge paycheck to go along with it, which isnt going to happen because nobody uses this shit in the real world.
this turns you on even more and you begin pleasuring yourself too

this vid from previous thread is fucking hilarious
this video is bang on
this was a bait shitpost, but for real i’m eyeing a power mac g4 right now, 1.25ghz for fucking around with os9 on
this was all last year
this was essentially me in college
this was my first thought
this was my workaround for that problem, what do you think?>i'm thinking i could create a few accounts on crypto and blockchain exchanges and then have it so that when you pay using whatever currency you're using, the website takes your coins, sends them to the exchange account, trades them for usd and then buys the product for you that you're looking to buy from whatever website.too much of a hassle?undoable?i posted that in a different thread, that's why i'm quoting it.
this was not a gift and they forced me over time to pay it back and i had to buy at their cost inventory to do the videos i uploaded for them
this was one of my servers in the datacenter.
this was pretty much the only reason i was considering staying team blue text as i’m pretty against macos, so fuck apple for the last time and i’m getting an android again when i get to japan next year
this was the beginning of the end.poettering achieved his victory in the election by exploiting a (((bug))) in systemd that allowed him to deliver propaganda straight to the terminal
this was the final straw that made me move to minti don't want an opinionated de, if i did i would just fucking go to windows again
this was true in the win95 times though
this was very true with the old touchjizz, and until like the note 4.but even on my note 4 i was able to disable pretty much all bloatware
this was without a doubt one of the first technologies.
this way i wouldn't have to switch the disks at all and safe me the trouble
this way, i can simply run make test, and it will recompile my c++ program if necessary, and then run my test script.now how the fuck do i get vs code to understand this very simple setup because it does not seem to have any idea what a makefile is.
this while being pragmatist, axon for instance has the n that stands for nvlink which is super closed as nvidia is known for.the opencapi interface is also quite robust, from networking to advanced memory modules, it would not surprise me if some vendor came up with some storage class memories (non volatile memory) implementation like mram, reram, 3d xpoint and the like.the thing is designed for super heavy duty workstation and hpc and those who really care about this also care about their security and overall control over their platforms.>>77276065what?
this whole thread is a fucking shitshow precisely because tards like yourself have their mind so deteriorated they think about nothing but politics 24/7 and leak onto other boards from overflowing cloaca that is pol.
this whole thread is a plethora of q.q combined with my old ass shit phone does it better.when will you guys realize you're destitute citizens living on state money who don't bring one dollar in and yet you think your shitty opinion matters?that asshole that makes crap money per month and jacks off to furry porn is more worth and more valid than anything you can push forward.+
this will allow you to upgrade to this build and remain here no matter what.
this will also be supported in b450/x470 motherboards.
this will be my first mechanical keyboard
this will be the final nail in the coffin
this will break with whitespace in filenames
this will create a power vacuum that india will exploit to wage war with china while russia annexes belarus.>how will social media and technology fuck everyone up?most popular social media will be unencrypted by mandate of law
this will get no replies compared to the meme responses but it's the correct answer op
this will include both writing and the drawn / pixel art assets.
this will kill nvidia.2) big navi top card will come with 24 gb of gddr6, it has 384 bit bus.a 384 bit bus with gddr6 can give the same bandwidth as 320 bit bus with gddr6x.3) big navi mid card will come with 16 gb of gddr6
this will kill the rtx 3070, 8gb are not enough for 4k gaming.4) much lower powerconsumption, less noise, less heat, no need for big cooler, no need for big vrm, thus keeping the costs down.with this alone amd will be able to lower the prices of the cards down, while offering more
this will never happen
this will not affect linux users because it's rare for a linux user to buy a very locked down piece of hardware in the first place and if they do it's easy for them to migrate to hardware from other companies (in fact linus torvalds used to run fedora on a mac)
this willdeter100%
this works but the latency is way too high

this would never pass quality control in windows or appel

this, and better hope they didn't buy anything on your account, because sony won't refund you
this, and defend it nail and tooth
this, apt and dnf are too much work, i type yay and it does shit for me
this, books and documentation are unironically the best way (plus actually fucking doing the work too)but whenever you tell someone who asked you for good resources, they throw a big stink about having to read a fucking 100 page textbook or 20 odd pages of docs and instead go look up youtube videos or some random dumbshit online course full of pajeets

those 5tb 2.5 drives are 15mm thick, 2 of them are wider than a 3.5 hdd
those are all true.
those are chinese sourced
those are developed and qa-ed with 10 times the intensity of the 10,000 packages that linux distributions control
those are fine
those are horrible for content creation though considering their average to downright shit color gamut.
those are just examples anyhow
those are the only recent games i really care about.oh, that and ps3/wii u/switch emulation (don't know if switch emulation is decent yet).
those are two good distributions that you can't go wrong with because of the popularity of their downstream distros.
those aren't official releases just some neet's reencodes

those type of things, this people somehow manage to survive and push their decisions onto others even do their form of witting is not substantiated by metric relevant to the performance of that particular software, this is probably due to the fact that not everyone is smart enough or doesn't want to establish a proper mechanism to measure performance and multiple other factors

we have a bsd thread open right now why not ask this there?
we have acpi, ahci, nvme and usb3 working but no modern gpu support yet.
we have colour monitors
we have no power
we have so much fucking space, that most of our country is used for agriculture, and the vast majority of produce farmed is exported out as trade goods

we have some of the highest taxes on salaries in the whole eu fuck off retard, out of uni you will get at most 1k euros, after you have half a decade worth of experience you might get up to 2 or 3 k something that a uni student in london would get from the very start
we have the same thread every 6 hours
we have to fight back and take the asia for ourselves
we have to regulate software engineering
we just have to fork it.
we knew it was illegal but there was no way to prove it and not worth it in court.>at first he bitched about this because it was losing the company money!
we make a html document and when the thread is archived i'll post a screen shit of the documenti'll start <!doctype html><html>
we may find a use for microplastics after all
we might even order you some pizza.
we might have to trash the wiki just like we did with arch.
we must into webdev and pajeet brainlet languages like java or python in order to get a job
we need cloud stuff!
we need linux + systemd containerd
we need to confirm you are not a man in drag.
we need to go back
we need to rename jails to something like halfwayhouses
we need to start over and cut our losses
we need to stop him!how?
we pretty much had open cheating in our course
we really need to work on that technology
we replaced most of our boomer infrastructure people with actual devs
we should actually try to get a real admin who will actually do what is best
we should move away from the intel/amd duopoly but i think it's silly for apple to be the ones to start especially since their products are geared towards people needing higher end stuff.
we should only allow the sperm with the best fit gene to reproduce
we still don’t know the extent of the damage but are working to find out and give our members the details as they become available
we still have 3g and do you see them sell any 3g phones anymore?
we still here?
we talking about fs2020 and not fsx, right?
we tested eight carriers to find out>verizon>average download speed 53.3 mbps>average upload speed 17.5 mbps show a speed test where it's <5mbps >i would like to see these 55 dollar plans because i have never in my life seen those plansit's on their fucking website, how much do you think people are paying for phones?$140 plan + 60 phone or something
we think it means macbooks are getting touch.
we took it after filthyfrank made those vids before becoming cool guy.
we took notice of your content and we loved what you posted!they didn't this is how they rope you in, anything with more than 1 million views in 3 days and they swoop in like an indian scammer.mandi actually flew up from miami to waverly ny, where i pick her up
we use hangouts at work at it works fine.
we used to shitpost with this list back in 2014 and 2015, it was the predecessor to the chink repelent tiannanmen pastabut it got slided with the chink pasta, glowniggers won that one using migapedes as useful idiots
we value your privacy.industry-leading security.hah!
we wanted them to elect government officials for us
we warned you bro.
we welcome our new friends with open arms
we were both looking at different words and we each heard the correct word
we will get them next time.
we will give you a call tomorrow.to proceed with the next step>never heard from them again.
we will just force you to sell your european branch of the company lmao
we will never forget you.i will never forgive those trannies and redditors who killed you.
we will never hire n----s, mandi might be trans but that's so we can fly under youtube's radar
we won freebros...
we write for free what other people have already written for money
we'd have to give it another name though, what do you lot think about bookmarks?
we'd like to check your laptop.>sir, we can't find windows or mac on your laptop
we'd need a new name<->address translation protocol, maybe on the blockchain (inb4 biz)?we need a new route discovery mechanism if we are to bypass isps (i.e
we'll fix it later (read never).> refactoring not facing customer, no do!
we'll get to see who is losing in 4-5 years to decide who to support next.
we'll have to see how good the first one is
we'll just use library.framework.sort( ) and -/g/:>nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo you don't understand you have to take 30 years off to basically re-write all the algos that already exist, in your own shitty way, but only in c, lisp, or haskell>if you don't completely know every single line of a framework how can you be sure it will work every single time despite, testing it and it worked over 50b+ times by nowyou gotta basically never have a programming job and dick around for 4 decades re-inventing the wheel..
we'll probably get a third version that finally gets it right in a few years.
we'll see next year hopefully
we're all going to be replaced with weak and upvote addicted people who are unable to hold on any foundation on their own
we're all just cogs in the machine maan
we're all never gonna make it.
we're allowed to hit those emails since it's b2b via a publically accessible email.and i don't care about how they feel about me emailing them unless they respond positively and want to buy it lol.
we're anyway
we're approaching a bottleneck, which is the real reason why nvidia is pushing rtx/realtime raytracing
we're back, baby!
we're brothers in arms man.
we're comparing to my eloop fans running at 150-250 rpm
we're going to be in a corporate technological nightmare pretty soon aren't we?
we're going to hire more people soon, but so far it's only me lol.
we're gonna have no fucking stock anywhere again.drivers aren't released yet so they're as good as paperweight today
we're gonna have no fucking stock anywhere again.https://www.hardwaretimes.com/ethereum-miners-eye-nvidias-rtx-30-series-gpu-as-rtx-3080-offers-3-4x-better-performance-in-eth/
we're in the middle of migrating to a new service now though thank fuck.
we're just looking the other way when they do.>>77275479it's an incomplete solution.
we're making one in other imageboard
we're not adding anyone to discord.
we're not comparing to poo fans or gentle typhoons running at 400 rpm though
we're not gonna speed feed you retarded underage idiot
we're not google!)
we're not harming anyone
we're true bare metal programmers stuck in a souless webdev era
we've all been there
we've all known them
we've got enough bugshit leftists and thots on this planet as it is.
weak gpu
wear a hat and hoodie, change up the location, keep moving
wear the stone of shame!are you considering self-hosting?
wearing a watch to be punctial is conscientious, in orderliness especially, and that causes these deficits according to their findings.>>77162418calm down.
wearing a watch to be punctual reduces focus, adaptability, creativity etc...https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00214.x>in our study, however, conscientiousness appeared to detract from decision-making performance after changes in the task context
web dev is comfy, i wish i had started learning this earlier
web dev is full of sheep, they see something new, they follow
web developers are now sorry to say, the backbone of commerce.but they are also responsible for some of the biggest fuck ups of the 21st century in terms of incompetence and security 101 neglect, i've seen dir traversal attacks started by casual users who got a url wrong customer email: hay, what's all this text with file icons in my browser, one of them has src and most of them end in php
web devs explain.
web extension support came back in safari 14
web games?
web instead
web pages should be feature rich
webassembly needs to get prodready (dom etc side too) asap so js can start dying and the human race starts a period of healing and self-reflexion, which should end it up concluding that companies like google needs to die and the us should be ashamed to what their companies did to the internet
webb & ted bloecher, humcat: catalogue of humanoid reports, case # a1629; albert s
webdev
webdev and entitlement.same sort of shit as with systemd, except people can tolerate using systemd.move to something like xfce or mate.
webdev is terrible but the entry to anything else is highly competitive and pretty rare
webdev is that
webdevelopers have to be some of the dumbest motherfuckers around
webkit is the base of all modern browsers
webp is essentially just a single frame webm
webrings are uncensored/unfiltered lists of websites
webrings were used for discovery, but now that we have search engines there is no need for it.
webshit is used by pajeets who are scared of compilers
webshitters realized their job might get deprecated since so much of crud can be automated by server-side frameworks and other shit can be done more easily and more popularly as mobile apps
websites are technology
wechat is banned in the us after 45 days, idk why you think this applies to outside of the us.
weeaboo face art, emojis, etc.
weird
weird flex but ok...and if what you're saying was true there wouldn't be some retard in god mode in every >20 player session

welcome to the world of chromeshit and electron apps, where we sacrifice cpu cycles and memory in the name of basedboi software
welcome to your local vps / self hosted thread
welcome to your new homepage, /g/http://52.62.74.10/
well /g/, why did he do it?
well at least that progress can be counted on.
well check how much time the copy code takes, you are profiling the code aren't you?also it makes a difference to use smaller pixels on screen because it's pretty much an array the cpu needs to go through the array to set a signal from high to low, and maybe the frequency of how many times it needs to read the array makes a difference.i think that you should start looking at open source code that could help you, might take you a few days to learn to read other's code though.
well crafted infographic, i wonder who is behind it?
well done
well done.
well fuck man, what are they doing then?
well given the fact that i know what i want and how to configure it
well have you thought about not sitting that far from such a small screen?
well he did miss the dot>>77106724check aforementioned quoteas an alternative you can use svf extractorhttps://www.softpedia.com/get/system/back-up-and-recovery/svf-extractor.shtml
well how about we stop fucking ignoring it.
well how the fuck am i going to connect to the internet without a modem?
well hypothetically there shouldn't be any legal issues with having cropped cp on your computer, but i wonder if github will be so understanding.
well i don't like it though
well i found this one for 3 dollars less!
well i guess having a good dba would help too hah
well i have tree nodes and the nodes have different types, so it's necessary to use the box<dyn trait> everywherei could use enums maybe, but matching everything just to have a bunch of arms calling the same function really annoyed me
well i mean, you can get a roku for $10
well i ordered last week, i think they ran out
well i tried to switch from arch/systemd/xorg/i3 to voidlinux/runit/wayland/sway..
well i'll run you through what i have done so far.i tried to do the instructions detailed here under approach 11: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/bios_upgrade/x_seriesbut when i try to boot from the usb, it just goes black for a second and goes straight back to the boot options menu
well i'm not an expert in mac, as i've said: i'm not an itoddler
well i've daily driven both of them and while i think the t4 overall sounds better, the t3 isnt as meh as i remember
well if i actually had to get one for work i'd just look at my co workers and go from there
well if i had financial aid from family etc
well if i were you i would get the 4axl or 5
well it all started here!
well it is known nvidia locks down features that hardware supports by disabling them in software
well it is the office of the company selling these
well it is where i am
well it was made by a white man.
well it's 20 year old hardware so i have no use for it, the cpu was the only cool thing that was still intact
well it's like that old joke, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you
well just list whatever they send and then tell everyone who's connected that the list updated and send them the new string
well maybe don't assign the same letter to all your drives?unplug j, plug in old h...
well member about antistatic principles, member your sockets and plug, bios settings, shit like this
well okay, can do calculators.my body is ready.

well said
well shit, that makes sense
well sorry for not being rich>>77033647no i'm perfectly ok with that, android uses too much battery, i want a long lasting and robust dap, i love camping after alland relatively cheapalso i dont mind adding 1 more cable after all, it's not like 13 years ago when everything is proprietary

well that wasn't concise
well that's why it's a meme, like most of things on craigslist
well the number is 3 times larger than 1080 so id say 213c

well then, complain
well they are censoring searches that criticize their more controversial approach to business and instead replace the top results with articles such as no, google isn't collecting your data, but if it did that would be a good thing.so you're not far off.
well those days are gone
well we had the clusterfuck for years before it became clusterfuck cubed after the trannies got their aids infested mitts at the ends of self-scarred forearms on it.

well with russia taking down bitchute now...
well yeah do you have any idea how expensive that'd be?
well yeah, mpv is one single file
well yes but i was not talking about you, was i?
well you better like doing crosswords
well you got fucked what do we do with this thread nowany ideas?
well you ruined your own thread regardless so good job
well you’re just starting out in life to, don’t feel to bad about it, once you figure out where you want to be in life and where do you want to be say five years from now it becomes easier to work towards a goal.there is nothing wrong with moving back in with your parents and sacrificing a year in order to save for a down payment, if you do it now you won’t have to do it six years from now.
well, another fix is to load a catalog in a new tab, and continuously load new tabs from that page until you get to the thread you want
well, are you unique?https://amiunique.org/fp
well, china likely wouldn't--because doing so fades the control of their regime and they can't control it
well, did he return it?
well, enjoy driving everyone in your life away from you with your insane paranoid schizophrenic ideas
well, honestly, no not anyone would help you, which is why that doesn't work here, yeah /fglt/ does help sometimes, but the chances of that happening depend on a lot of factors, and by the time you get a repsonse you may not need help anymore, whereas in the dedicated tech supp channel, in the unixporn discord, people are more likely to see it, it doesn't shit up the thread, cause it's a dedicated channel for that specific thing
well, how dare you to use chinese communist botnet instead of american botnet.you are an enemy of the free world[tm]

well, i did have a p225f once
well, i do spoof my mac, and any identification could lead to me, in fact, i recorded some others' computer names and changed mine to it to blend in.that being said, i noticed a couple of times no-windows vans parking and wandering around, with the driver sitting inside all the time, pretending he's the maintenance guy, could be legit or no, don't care.
well, i don't know about that
well, i might try one of those too, the fit may not be a problem with me, after all, most people told me the tin t2 had a terrible fit but i find it very comfortable, anyways, thanks for the info.
well, i was one of those gaymers that wanted an upgrade for newer hardware
well, if you don't want floating windows, you can force it by adding --no-video to the emms-player-mpv-parameters variable.another reason i find mpv useful is that you can play youtube videos and playlists from it
well, it doesn't really
well, it just seems plausible based on what i've seen so far
well, it's just a matter of patience they all will be fast soon
well, its main selling point was its tablet capabilities (for the late 90s anyway)but you are right

well, like i said, the humans have to be modified first.
well, not npc, just fucking dumb.
well, stackoverflow and github are a techfag's social media and they're spamming this crap everywhere because the creators pander to them.whether or not its good, i dont care

when talking to autodesk, their response is always we will patch it next update, please see this irrelevant kb article, or the fix is a clean windows install, or you need to recreate your central model (networked project file).i do like what revit did to the industry over good old autocad, but it's one of those crusty old single threaded windows programs that have been hacked together from different libraries and patched over and over over decades into a monstorous, unmaintainble, and unstable codebase.sadly, there is no alternative revit is the defacto industry standard in the us.also, they install telemetry bullshit on every install that you need to manually disable.tldr: fuck autodesk, free software alternative when?

when you launch a program in a terminal, the programs take control of the window and redraw it, instead of opening another windowit is integrated in the os (with graphics)the colourscheme is a very nice choice of pastel color (choiche made out of laziness, but ended up nicely)mouse chording is better than keyboard driven interaction(kinda) everthing is a text, output of terminal can be edited, it is just outputin fact you can save a clean log of a terminal session by deleting all the unnecessary staff it kinda remove the need of copy paste: instead of pasting a long path given in output you can write before of after it and then sending in execution > from usability perspective network is integrated in the osyou have /net/ndb which is a breeze for managing network connection factotum for centralize key manager

while larger laptops can have more space for batteries, nobody's going to make one with more than 100wh
while no modern operating system, not even windows, implements correct responses to just a carriage return or just a line feed, you can, at least, observe the correct behavior in a bios environment: if you write a bare metal assembly program that uses bios routines to print text, chances are, printing only a carriage return will return you to the start of the same line to begin overwriting it, and printing only a line feed will simply move the cursor one position downward.
while research may be done and progress may be made to help create treatments (or provide preventative guidelines) for a single type of cancer, there will never be a cure for cancer as a whole.additionally, the only good model for human cancer is in humans and performing research on humans runs into very strong ethical and legal boundaries

workstations and servers linux is basically king.all of your other concerns are mostly the things only desktop users give a shit about
workstations cases are the business style without the good airflowall the powerfull workstation i've seen used that aren't in a server are standard mesh atx or bigger
worse keyboard and screen options tho
worse than normal?
worst are .pф coz you need type all site name in russian letters
worst battlestations youve ever seeni got some gems
worst case scenario the licence means somebody couldn't use it.
worst city to be a compsci major in because it's overloaded with poos and roodypoos that go there to get the same degree for free
worst korea is just a shitty americanized military outpost at this point
worth a try
worth it
worth it even if i'd need to replace the screen?7th gen i7
worth it?
worthless anecdotal evidence (although yes, not using your hard drive will make it last longer (up to the point where it seizes up and can't spin up again)):>>77098129>>77098217>>77098315i want to say that this is a good enough sample size but you haven't specified the models, whether or not you're using all the same model for each manufacturer and whether or not you discriminate between wd and seagate in your use case>>77098296we need to look at the numbers bros, otherwise these drive companies will spend money on worthless pr instead of qa and research.

yandex is already the best search anyway.
yandex is superior to google.
yandex ist actually goodcompare image searching for jew on google and in yandex.your search history still ends up being datamined by a big company that does bad things sometimes.but at least you get good results.sometimes i think the googe people have se lgbt agenda that fucks with the results

yay or nay?
yay!
ye i think the 10xx series made a significant improvement.
ye, thats what i saidwhat do you mean
yea
yea bro the elections and political system are definitely not a theatrical sham owned and controleld by the holding corps which retain shares for all tech companies, media corporations, food and resource corporations, and government lobbying groups
yea if visuals matter oled is the way to go desu
yea it can suck ass when they are the only game in town.just keep the advice in mind for the future.or at least keep a fire extinguisher near the pc.
yea sure>he goes into back room and calls the popos on my ass like i done stole my laptop>fucking pigs arrest me for stealin my own laptop>lose my job n shiet>gotta deal drugs no cuz noone gon hire me
yea you had black magic/ white magic shit even in africa
yea, no problem back when i casually did this on gentoo
yea, there is a flatpak but i prefer native, it's alright.
yeah
yeah after it passes winograd schema challenge
yeah and ?
yeah and an email service run by someone from this hellhole that goes down every other week is cream of the crop.
yeah because american pro-nationalists totally approve of the rest of the world treating americans like plague rats
yeah because there was this thing called a north bridge
yeah bro, voting for someone is going to change everything!!!
yeah but docker isn't
yeah but even in that context the tablet part sucks for general use, ce was really underdeveloped for all-touch devices at that pointbest sh-4/ce portable is probably the compaq aero 8000, the sh-4 absolutely saws through the competition at the cost of being less than compatible with many applications, though most of the shit you'd want has sh4/svga builds
yeah but for some reason the wifi option is not there with some apps
yeah but how common is that, really?
yeah but how will that get me a 14yr old chinese wife?
yeah but is it really the best way to use your time?
yeah but it's my cum
yeah but that's not very long at all, my other server has way better uptime
yeah but to be fair it's been massively improving ever since canonical got involved
yeah but..
yeah c++ is my end goal but i'll need to learn both c and cpp eventually so i'm just going to start with c
yeah ddg is just an inferior google at this point
yeah exactly
yeah fans work fine
yeah gonna buy apple silicon desktop imac day one
yeah he surely patches all the security vulnerabilities and doesn't just increase the date on the android security patch.
yeah i bet you use it for anything else
yeah i can agree with you on asus
yeah i did that
yeah i guess
yeah i know but i don't want a secondhanded old cheap motherboard, i don't know where to start searching
yeah i know the cpu is shiti'm putting together a threadripper pc soon
yeah i personally am a big fan of mid range and treble so i tend to lean that way in choice (other than liking the oh10 a ton and the er2xr)
yeah i realised that while typing
yeah i see what you mean..
yeah i set it to legacy boot and still goes to this screen
yeah i tried getting a new one but for some reason they are impossible to find on my country now
yeah i used speedfan back in the day, didn't know how to use bios either
yeah i used that example because the more i study music, the less magical and more formulaic and calculable it seems
yeah i would hate spending 20 bucks on a phone from last year if it has shit particles embedded on the screen protector
yeah i'm honestly about to leave too
yeah i'm just gonna go drive truck nowfuck mainline software companies they are too woke for me.>>77194197i like perl but its bloat
yeah i'm referring to thing like ohh mx blues are the best, mmm kailh browns so good autism.
yeah i'm thinking he's back
yeah if only there was some kind of games platform that wrapped the controls for you haha
yeah im a fucking gamer so no i dont know about the engineering side besides the marketing ploys.>>77361308yeah well at least some of their listing say its real pbt and not some knockoff
yeah it seems decent to try out
yeah it's a good distro because it has good repos and that's all that separates distrosmate?
yeah it's a subpar workflow
yeah it's all the rage because he's a twitter celeb
yeah it's nice, i prefer triple monitor though.
yeah its has issues but its pretty kino
yeah just work for free lmao
yeah lol it’s a huge step back and for dumb memers
yeah m8, i feel the same
yeah man what kind of man would i be if i didnt get mad
yeah man, i'm sure the 13 year old that is going to be affected by this now is going to have i hate republicans seared into his brain 15 years from now when he decides to get his lazy ass up and vote
yeah no
yeah of course criminals are extraordinary people.
yeah pic is pretty goodi think the main problem with the majority of configurations is the font
yeah s(he) is
yeah same too anon
yeah so i definitely need to watch this
yeah so you want to disable the router webpage on the lan side too?
yeah so.
yeah such an obvious bias that they have one pro brexit person out of 5...
yeah sure just let me get my tools ok?
yeah that democracy is so fake that the ancient politicians are all ganging up against trump
yeah that shit doesn't seem worth $8 a month
yeah that's a good description.i hate taa for how blurry it looks so yeah.i maintain that a 720p image(with maybe some msaa) on a good crt monitor looks a lot better in comparison to 720p dlss and it also comes without any dlss artifacts.
yeah that's a good desktop environment too but i prefer kde
yeah that's karma
yeah that's why i have like four 8gb usbs with different versions of mac os xmakes things a million times easier to reinstall macos
yeah thats cool and all dude butthe twitter hack guy is 19 years old and the applefag pic is from like 2011
yeah thats pretty much /g/ without the /g/eneral threads
yeah the guys who wrote books about readability ruined the field
yeah the main line of leaks at this point is pretty much exactly what the final product will be
yeah the nice thing about cryptocurrency is the money trail is public information that anyone can checkout themselves, unlike current private banking where laundering can be hidden
yeah the text-tool sucks, but everything else is good.i wish they would take a look at photoshops text-tool and just let me write directly on the picture without that little window
yeah there's more to it, this just prints out all the posts on /g/, then i got a bash script to pipe it to the botbut the bot itself is just seeborg which you can find on github
yeah there's no reason to upgrade it now, maybe in 3 or 5 years 4k becomes the standard.
yeah they claim its ergonomically disparative to the human paradigm of interacting with a computer
yeah they could also move the registry to a container that legacy apps can talk to.
yeah they didour cries for help finally worked
yeah they do
yeah they dowhy do you think amerimutts say asian instead of yellow
yeah this guy kind of gives it away
yeah too bad vivaldi is bloatware lol
yeah well i made a motorcycle when i was 4 years old
yeah whatever i used it but it isn’t anything specialwindows is superior
yeah why doesn't 4chinz accept proprietary google images?
yeah why not a webcam that sits on the desk with on built in, half the people posting em have em on stands that look like they sit in front of their face
yeah you can make your own plugins and or get someone else's (they call it 'workflows').
yeah you said something even more retardedly vague and unactionable like a typical shill
yeah you're right about waiting
yeah your projects in /dpt/ are cool but fuck you you arrogant piece of shit
yeah, 100%
yeah, a brother laser printer with 3rd party cartridges
yeah, and kinda unrelated, but from my experience with chi-fi iems as well, i think it's best to just stay away from chinese brand headphones and iems
yeah, and that's not really all of it either, 2 other hdds have anime folders.
yeah, artifacting is never a good, and your best bet is to start looking for a new card.i think when a card is artifacting, it's usually the memory that's good bad
yeah, billy g was always right.
yeah, but i decided to focus on writing my own language instead
yeah, but i think it's because it's a shitty school i didn't get anything
yeah, but it doesn't have a ton of css and a giant 4k video background.
yeah, but that kinda doesn't matter when we're just talking about why a company is moving more product than others.
yeah, but you were paying them 80 dollars in shipping you asshat, go buy it from that seller
yeah, buy programmer socks and chop ur dick off
yeah, he's even exploiting his parents after his wife and friends left him
yeah, i actually meant to warn op that shp900 aren't great for bassy stuff, you'd be better off with the 20 dollar monoprice closed back headphones if you want kicking bass.
yeah, i mean amd even has the 4700g up on their website, but they are saying that it's for oems only...
yeah, i think i started using linux when i was 12-13
yeah, i think i'm going to get one to replace my 3.5 year old oneplus 3t
yeah, i think that dev version issues also go there, but still, what the fuck is going with dev releases?
yeah, i used it a lot when i was in high school.
yeah, i was surprised when i found it
yeah, i'm aware
yeah, i'm not a high profile person
yeah, imagine carrying the same shitty ux for almost 2 decades and being beaten by a tablet de, gnome 3 sucks but finder and the dock are worse.
yeah, it doesn't force a garbage collector on youit doesn't have a functioning standard library eitherthere is nothing about c that makes it faster than other compiled languages by defaultsome parts of c are even inherently slow, like null-terminated strings
yeah, it has really low level stuff
yeah, it only mentions bitrate but there are a ton of other options so i'm guessing he just used the defaults but again there are so few details given that it is hard to say
yeah, it really does seem that way
yeah, it truly is fascinating how many times you can tell those people the lie that something is privacy respecting without them ever verifying your claim.
yeah, it was bound to become just that sooner than later.
yeah, it was more of a saleperson/casual thing.back in the dos days, port was port
yeah, it's a tradeoff
yeah, it's nice to be using it for rendering a frame, but i'd sure like to apply that processing power in other ways.
yeah, it's so private it installs a scheduled system task to report to pozilla every day
yeah, it's worse.>>77063211>use something worthless insteadnah.>>77068090the official documentation is extremely good.
yeah, knowledge of wpf, uwp, winapi and powershell is also considered to be an employable skill and those are, for the most part, specific to windows.
yeah, linux distros are a blessing in that aspect
yeah, maybe 3 years ago.
yeah, most of what i have is either in my head or written down somewhere
yeah, no point in using xfce over other gtk des.>>79397798>>79399629why do so many youtubers shill manjaro?
yeah, pretty much.
yeah, realised i hadn't mentioned to just copy the contents, not the folder itself.
yeah, remember it took about an hour to get a track most of the time because you'd end up leeching at 3kb/second and it would slow your internet down so you couldn't do much else
yeah, so change the focusthe focus should be security, and open source is the right waydont trust, verify
yeah, sonnys, if you don't do fortran you're mot a real programmer.
yeah, sure, it's about 100 times more powerful than it needs to be, but whatever.
yeah, thankfully the 3080 is releasing soon, so if the reviews are great, so will the 3070
yeah, thanks
yeah, the 90 second default was fucking ridiculous
yeah, the days when google decided to force people to use google+ when nobody asked for it
yeah, they all go in the filesystem.
yeah, they should have at least done some basic normalization of use cases at least (either pie or bar style), that's basic excel shit.instead they tried to combine 2 visualizations into 1 and lost all meaning.
yeah, vanilla unstable.
yeah, when this computer shits itself, i'm going to build my laptop and use a shucked 3 tb ssd.
yeah, you usually jump to nearly 100ms lag with interpolation
yeah.
yeah..
yeah.might check the nat thing.>>77037728>vpsi'm self-hosting.anyway, my modem/router combo refuses to go bridged-mode only, so i can't check like that.but i have run nmap before and sometimes i get some random ports marked as closed instead of filtered
yeahthings like regexregex is a couple 1000 lines of codeas it says @ the start of the oreilly tome, regexthousands of pagesits just a fking jokeppl say 'learn things'you get to a stagewhere you know you have to write everything, yourselfever written a regex?

you could call me a friend.
you could discuss the content in online forums
you could dispute that, but why would you since it isnt your copyright after all and you'd loose any legal battle over it.so there's really two things that can happen once the copyright holder flagged your video (if they find it in the first place):either they put ads in it and get a share of the revenue (most copyright holders seem to do that nowadays), or they can take it down

you know, there was a nigger once, he went by the name of croix89 on jewtube, he made a small rant on emulators and piraters because they were hippocrates and whatnot, saying that we complained modern game companies don't develop good games but we also don't pay them to play their games and shit, but then i remember about the absolute fucking greed of gaming companies:>nintendo stripping away monetisation from g*mplay of their games and pocketing it citing intellectual property>ea ripping studios apart and wringing the programmers of any joy>ubisoft being a bitch about everything>valve not releasing a game in a decade because they're happy with gay ass card games like artifact>xaviant creating the abomination known as the culling 2>rockstar games raping 2 of the greatest games of the last decade with microtransaction and piss poor online connection>bethesda financially gutting obsidian and making fallout 76 somehow even more of a joke than fallout 4, which is somehow more of a joke than fallout 3,which is somehow more of a joke than new vegas, which is just utterly fucking retarded>activision is bad only for existing at this point: 10 years, barely any innovation>unrelated to all of the above but gamestop is basically a fucking skyrim vendor: why this sword is legendary, i ripped it from the hands of a famouse nord warr- 20 gold coins take it or leave itin short, no

you loose power to heat each work action performed, drag on the pistons, etc
you lose some capacity vs raid 0, but it isn't half the total capacity like with raid 1 or a backup.

you might want to replace them to be safe.
you might want to use old versions of libraries or tools if you want reproducible builds, or for forensic investigation, like gpl violations.

you turn the phone off, you enter a pin to decrypt it.if you were stupid enough to format your phone, you not only destroyed the key, but then the phone reinstalled the operating system and then re-encrypted itself, essentially overwriting your precious data.and that's why you keep your precious memories on microsd cards
you underestimate the number of normies that are around you
you use centos/debian or *bsd on servers, that's it.
you use high letters which are most likely free
you use it all the time, why not spend a little extra and get the best?invest in yourself.g-pro wireless.

you work for apple?
you would be using pale moon if you disapprove supporting monopolies.
you would have to go back in time to the 00s to find people who actually cared about making video games rather than spreading their warped ideology.
you would have to setup the default ivy sorting to be alphabetical.(defun call-without-sorting () (interactive) (let ((ivy-prescient-enable-sorting nil))) (call-interactively 'your-counsel-function)))
you would instantly buy it if it was some anime brand with a cute girl on the box
you would need larger cables so they don't get hot and thus increase resistance (reducing efficiency) or potentially burning out
you would need to make the cooler surface perfectly straight too then

you'd have to download that tool and use the clean option and after making sure it's cleaned up, install kms_vl_all
you'd have to find a really weird loan document that would be any different, but maybe that is what they are secretly trying to do with this phone locking shenanigans
you'd likely get a better experience with a cheap-ass membrane board
you'd wanna randomize it a bit so it looks like a human, instagram blocks and rate limits obvious bot stuff, although less to block stuff like what you're doing and more cause of scraper websites and rehosterd
you'll already have it ingrained things to avoid, there are so many ways to blow off your face with c++ that are needlessly complicated and frustrating
you'll be able to get better processing power due to the core and gpu count (you'll need to optimize for 16fp) and will cost you 1/2 the price and is more scalable.
you'll be laughed out of the industry.
you'll distract yourself in other ways or find a way to turn the internet back on
you'll do far better re-compliling whatever program you're trying to use.
you'll either have to code, do math, do a communications job or mine bitcoins with yourself.the brain-in-the-jar better come with sensory cameras or offline sensory simulations, too

you'll feel the friction as you switch to other computers that aren't yours
you'll find many similar stories with the forensics labs local law enforcement uses
you'll get what i develop as a final product and that's me being kind, it's up to you to build it from scratch if you need changes in the future.

you're asking about ui and ux
you're autistic and associate high treble + low base with quality
you're damn right i'm hoping those things are ovens
you're denying my cultural heritage
you're either baiting or retarded.depending on 32 vs 64 bit in c/c++ a long/ulong has a varying max value equivalant to a 32 bit int or an actual 64 bit current gen long equivalent.

you're fully tracked.
you're getting angry jew replies because you use a usb mic, so they assume you're a zoomerhere's a good upgrade path>micakg p220>interfacem-audio air 192|4
you're getting it wrong, linux is well prepared for arm based computers, in fact it was even before windows itself
you're gonna get tracked anyway, just make sure the one who collects and analyses the data is in the wrong country.
you're gonna need to wear a full set of cover-all's and a mask to make sure your skin doesn't crust off into the room, not to mention you can't eat your beloved cheetos while you jerk anymore.
you're gookidook nonsense you dummy
you're half right

you're literally retarded
you're literally retarded.
you're misreading the pic
you're missing the point, you can't complain about others spying on you after you've spied on everybody else, it's called being a hypocrite.
you're modifying the system in place to protect you, so what did you think was going to happen in terms of them telling you they aren't gonna support
you're my favourite poster on /g/

you're right i was just jealous of your l33t skillz.you should totally bring up this code in your next job interview

you're right.soul is still a retarded buzzword.
you're saying you're the same as them?
you're seriously wasting what little time you have left copypasta-ing every linux thread, trying to convert people who've already decided.
you're simply not worth anyone's time unless you have a wikipedia page.if you really really want to get into security just get a contract with a big company and 5 years from now people will maybe take you seriously
you're so god damn special
you're still an idiot for using both.
you're still an insecure newfag and it's painfully obvious to everyone here, lurk more, preferably permanently.
you're still kind of harming yourself mentally when you use those alternatives, right?
you're still minimally conscious even if you're not dreaming.
you're sucking out cool air
you're supposed to be 18 to post here
you're supposed to click and laugh and share it, so others can click and laugh, and potentially share it too.
you're talking about browser-based js developers right anon?
you're the man now dog
you're the one studying meme computing
you're the one that's bitching and complaining now.
you're the reason that apple is worth so much as a company
you're thinking of freeware, smartie
you're to blame
you're too stupid to use gnu/linux.pls buy every apple product and don't try anything else
you're totally different!
you're using mpv to play videos anyway.or you could host an instance on a rpi.
you're very confused, anon
you're waifu still a shit
you're wasting your hardware by using bsd
you're welcome
you're welcome kidhttps://github.com/stax76/openwithplusplus
you're wrong
you've been niggerlisted
you've been using linux since 98 and dont have a backup distro in mind?
you've built a caching machine for kiddy porn.
you've got 5 hours to save your most precious data to a 64gb sd card before an s-level disaster strikes and wipes out all computers for the next 10 years
you've made this thread three time today now
you've misrepresented the things i've said
you've nothing to lose by trying it out.
you've raised issues in- in a scattered way, several different issues!
you've ruined most western companies.
you've spent the cost of about 1.4 new cards for 4 slightly less good ones which then have gotten straight to work on whatever it is you're doing
you, on the other hand, live for another four minutes, and then join her in death.>the ai doesn't know what to say
youd really want to hollow them out cause their cases honestly are pretty one of a kind
young women (12-16) will make you kill *yourself* through coordinated pressure
your 100k a year gets you a 4000 sqft house.
your 93 is our 97.3, so i guess we have equal petrol, you just get a mid range option
your a faggot that is baiting for attentionbut not 100% offthe worst part about it is how hard it is to break into the chinese market
your ability to figure out the solution to a problem is going to priceless
your account was probably hacked.>>78599935>a microsoft accountif he had this he would be less likely to get hacked.
your acronyms are likely an indicator of how shitty you are at creative.
your ass?
your average vim/emacs shit doesn't hold a job, just like he hasn't for the last 20 years and won't his entire life, and turned even the most basic process of editing a file into a virtual little video game xdddd where they can pretend to be superior who use a non-autistic editor
your behavior is irrational and destructive to not only yourselves but every living creature on this planet.
your best bet is to schedule your exam 2 months out and then start studying your ass off
your body is a machine of pure filth
your boot code for one board likely isn't going to work on other boards, etc, with how thing are currently with arm.while you are correct about risc v, and i'd love a robust risc v system, but they just don't exist in a practical way.
your buddies obviously
your build looks like it has broken ram, but take a look at this:https://pcpartpicker.com/list/glkfqqoptionally:upgrade to ryzen 3600 for +$50upgrade to 1660 super for +$80
your capacitor was likely from a fan header, or cpu pwm
your code repo should block all pushes to production
your comment made me laugh hard enough to check the graph
your complaint is useless.
your computer is running an unmodifiable version of minix that will only let you boot your goyim os after being initialized
your constitution is dead and you can't just say let's care about it again >:(gotta start fresh or nobody cares.
your coworker just needs to rebase his change.
your cpu is for budgeted gaming and runs on zen+, just with integrated graphics.3600mhz is overkill, let alone a cl14 onehttps://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/what-ram-to-get-for-ryzen-5-3400g.3581172/
your data is worthless, no one is gonna use it for anything.
your decision becomes easier then.>i did buy the radeon viis at $700 each
your display has be physically capable of displaying 120 fps which is why the 1ms gtg response time metric is so important else you just get a massive smear of pixels like on the ipad pro.
your dog sheds
your environment and everything is probably going to be pretty specific to you, dont listen to anyone just figure it out
your example is completely feasible at least speaking to the tanks
your fault for having a non-free wi-fi.
your fucking jewishness is beginning to get annoying.
your game looks dope assuming op is the author, howeveron the site theres a little thing about the c64 running at 60hz..
your goal is to achieve a point where you feel fairly confident that you can be inconspicuously just present
your gpu is dying, fucking duh.
your grandchildren will never get to know what compiler was.
your guys are literally leading an industry revolt to get rid if all words that trigger you lol
your idea is a waste of time, though
your idiot customers can install it
your inclination will be to blame the drivers and not your psu at first.windows 10 is remarkably good at continuing to work and recover when a gpu crashes or even fails completely
your isp can't see what you're doing, but honestly you don't need a vpn to disguise your tor traffic and using a vpn with tor is outright retarded anyway
your just as bad of a shitposter as he is
your laptop has a smart card reader right, anon?
your list is set to private.
your loss
your mom
your mom faggot
your mom's ass is bloat lmao
your neighbor would have to come to your house, ring your fucking bell, get in, come right up to you, and aim a microwave gun right at your head for you to get sick, you paranoid fuck.>>>/x/
your new laptops will eventually utilize the 2000mb/s speed, but meanwhile it'll be backwards compatible with whatever shit speed /g/'s usb ports provide them with, which is probably 5gbps
your opinion is only important if it is nuanced
your opinion?
your original claim was that the xor swap broke his code, but it in fact did not
your own
your own rolled encryption methods are never secure.
your pc is just shit>werksforme
your phone itself is botnet, you can't debotnet a phone, otherwise it wouldn't be a phone
your phone’s in the press now.when we look at the press release of samsung’s new folding phones, the first thing that attracts us is the disappearance of traffic jams
your php shitter knowledge should translate just fine to node express.js + whatever templating lang
your pitiful begging disgusts me.
your player is all this crap
your post is a contradiction.
your president.that just means you both suck for doing so
your processor is dead, its not your fault that better shit exists
your program will be one executable that's <1kb.
your punishment is to be introspective for 20 minutes a day for 2 weeks
your retardation destroyed your notebook
your router always runs some form of nat, otherwise you'd be connecting directly to the modem and limited to a single device (to ip mapping).>>77396795this anon is retarded for not even being able to point out the obvious.>>77396819most isps run carrier grade network address translation, to save on ip addresses
your screenshot (node editor) reminded me that blender is a also a viable video editor
your search ends here because my desktop >>77081355 is elite
your server should return different html page that does not use semantic tags when a not supported browser requests a page
your snapchat posts are going to be blurry no matter how good the camera is because it's android, you're going to be a green bubble, and as the other anon said, no one even knows what a pixel is
your social signalling means nothing now that the globalist oligarchs are back in charge
your solution would be made unusable in 5 mimutes by some soiboy spamming it from a raspberry pi.we need a web of trust solution
your state of mind is so warped and deteriorated that everyone who disagrees with you is a transsexual communist with a sexual preference for african americans.
your statement is correct for most mobile cards except the 1650 that matches 1:1 it's desktop counterpart for some mysterious reason.
your strawman just shows that you misunderstand me
your system volume hasn't changed.in linux, technically, you can achieve that, too
your user trust factor probably isn't high enough, try creating some quality threads, if you get enough unique replies your score will go up
your version of winrar is out of date.
your whole day is spent grunting out a turd, because god cursed you with horrible bowels
your wife is very cute anon!
youre right.microsoft bought dos from another company, changed it a bit, recalled it ms-dos, and then built windows around it later.but this was still a command under billy g.making him a flying fucking tard

youtube shills first claimed that the 10700k was bad and everyone should go 10600k
youtube threads should be an automatic 30 day ban.
youtube videos are in webm formatyou can watch webm
youtube-dl + ffmpeg
youtube-dl-gui
you’ll also need to learn web dev to some degree in order to avoid becoming obsolete since clearly that’s the direction of the industry in general
you’ll get it eventually
you’re better off just writing an imageboard.

yup.

zen 2 had a huge ipc increase over zen+
zen 2 released months after its announcement.
zen 3 is 7nm+zen 4 (2021/2022) is 5nm
zen 4 apus wouldn't be until 2022 at earliest and if they are still using vega units i'll be sad.
zen has basically been server chips until zen 3
zen is the most power-efficient x86 architecture too.
zenfone 6 is no longer available and i really don't want to buy oneplus or xiaomi.
